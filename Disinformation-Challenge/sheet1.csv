Press Progress,Big Majority Expects Major Social Reforms and ‘Transformation’ of Canadian Society After COVID-19,https://pressprogress.ca/big-majority-expects-major-social-reforms-and-transformation-of-canadian-society-after-covid-19/,Most partisan bias,,"Fair interpretations of the news
",,"""The next federal election could shape up to be a battle over what the “new normal” in Canadian society should look like after COVID-19.

According to new polling from EKOS, a clear majority of Canadians agree that the pandemic has exposed “ugly truths” about how workers and the elderly have been treated in Canada under the old status quo.

Three-quarters (73%) of Canadians said they now expect a “broad transformation of our society” as a result of the pandemic, with a majority saying they expect to see major social reforms that prioritize “health and well-being.”

“In searching for some positives in the short-term ruins of the pandemic, we are seeing some signs that this might be a segue to a better future which may not have been attainable without this tremendous shock to societies,” EKOS notes.


Ekos

In all, 70% said the pandemic is creating the conditions for major reforms focused on the “health and well-being” of ordinary Canadians, while 30% see a future that is “more authoritarian, stressing nationalism and security.”

Canadians are leaning towards that utopian vision of the future across all categories and partisan affiliations, with the exception of those who self-identify as supporters of the Conservative or People’s Party, who are evenly split on the question.

Canadians agree the pandemic has exposed “ugly truths”: The polling data also finds four-in-five Canadians agree the COVID-19 crisis has “revealed” problems in the treatment of elderly and disabled Canadians and social class inequality in Canadian society.

“A plurality believe it has revealed some ugly truths about the values we placed on the lives of the elderly and vulnerable. Many also believe that it has revealed some of the previously hidden injuries of social class,” EKOS notes.

The poll also finds a “sizable majority” think the crisis underlines the need to shift to a greener economy in the post-pandemic world.

Stephen Harper disagrees: One person who can sense which way the winds of change are blowing is a former Canadian prime minister and current chairman of the Munich-based International Democratic Union.

Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Stephen Harper warns global financial elites that the case for austerity may “encounter serious resistance” now that workers have seen what government can accomplish when the full power of the state is actually focused on the health and well-being of workers:

“… Opposition this time may even be stronger. Many workers have been reduced to limited stipends by government-ordered shutdowns … Those laid off in public institutions have generally received full pay. Their experience of a guaranteed maximum income will feed the delusion that current economic and fiscal management is somehow viable.”"""
Rabble,Lessons from COVID-19: We are only as strong as our weakest link,https://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/views-expressed/2020/03/lessons-covid-19-we-are-only-strong-our-weakest-link,Most partisan bias,,"Fair interpretations of the news
",,"""There is a lot we still don't know about COVID-19 (coronavirus) and how hard it will impact Canada. But one thing we're learning: we are only as strong as our weakest link.

COVID-19 is exposing a number of weak links globally and here in Canada.

For starters, critical to containing COVID-19 are two new 2020 buzzwords -- social distancing and self-isolation. Health officials are asking people to do their part by staying home if they're sick and preparing to have two weeks' worth of medicine and provisions.

While staying home is known to help curb the spread of COVID-19, it's hard advice to swallow if you're poor, working poor, in the service industry or self-employed.

As Hamilton Roundtable for Poverty Reduction director Tom Cooper points out in this Hamilton Spectator op-ed, the working poor can't afford to take unpaid time off and people on fixed (low) incomes -- such as people on social assistance -- don't have extra cash to stockpile provisions.

""If we truly want to keep our communities healthy and protect against the spread of illness, whether COVID-19 or anything else in the future, we need to pay more attention to the relationship between health and income inequality in Canada,"" Cooper writes.

It's not just the poor who face barriers. Precarious workers have challenges too.

Jon Shell, managing director and partner at Social Capital Partners, points out that self-employed workers will suffer from COVID-19.

""Spare a moment for the self-employed today as you focus on not touching your face,"" Shell tweeted. ""They can't avoid travel, need to go to client sites, and get no income if they self-quarantine. No corporate support and our social support system isn't designed to help them at all.

""We constantly push people to be 'entrepreneurial' and to 'hustle.' Let's remember that the lack of an appropriate and fair safety net for the self-employed is one of the many things this crisis is exposing. We need to fix it.""

In this Toronto Star column, Jim Stanford, director of the Centre for Future Work, points to the need for legislated sick pay, better job security for workers who may need to follow the 14-day self-isolation COVID-19 protocol and better employment insurance provisions for workers who cannot work because of illness.

Legislated sick pay is key: research shows that cities and states in the United States that require employers to provide paid sick days have fewer flu cases.

Getting rid of the need for doctors' sick notes is also key. Why flood doctors' offices with sick people when they should be at home resting and not spreading contagion?

COVID-19 could rock the global economy
Speaking of contagion, fears over COVID-19 and an oil sell-off led to panic in the stock markets Monday, forcing the New York and Toronto stock exchanges to briefly halt trading.

In the U.S., United Airlines and Jet Blue Airlines are cutting back flights due to a drop in demand due to COVID-19 fears.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada have cut interest rates in an attempt to protect the economy from a COVID-19/oil sell-off downturn.

Businesses are cancelling travel, conferences and meetings in response to the COVID-19 threat.

It's a reminder that the economy is only as strong as the health of our communities. And as Italy completely shuts down, COVID-19 is teaching us that we are only as strong as our weakest link in the global public health chain.

That's why investments in public health -- disease prevention, health promotion and protection -- are so critical.

Cuts to public health hurt
It's a lesson that seems to have gotten lost in Canada, all these many years after the SARS outbreak.

Across Canada, provincial governments have cut back on public-health spending. Just last year, the Ontario government made a move to slash public-health budgets and the Alberta government is in the process of implementing similar funding cuts. Other provinces have also seen dwindling public-health investments over the past decade.

The irony of public health is that it's undervalued until an invisible virus emerges, making the value of public health visible. After SARS, that visibility led to new investments in public health, but over time, funding has dwindled.

This Springer article says ""governments around the world underinvest in public health and public-health research.""

In the OECD, health spending for prevention is rarely higher than six per cent of the health care budget. In Canada, only 5.5 per cent of total health spending goes to public health, such as food and drug safety, health inspection and health promotion.

Trevor Hancock, retired public health professor at the University of Victoria, calls the underinvestment in public health short-term thinking.

""There are several factors at play, one of which may be that public health does not generate headlines, whereas dramatic life-saving interventions do,"" Hancock writes.

""When public health is effective, nothing happens; nobody writes headlines about the hundreds of cancers that did not happen, only about the latest hi-tech drug or intervention that reduced the death rate from cancer.""

The advent of COVID-19 is helping us see public health in a new light.

When it comes to trying to contain COVID-19 spread, we have strengths. Canada's public-health professionals took many lasting lessons from the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak and they are better prepared for COVID-19 than some countries.

Protocols were in place to quickly identify potential COVID-19 patients and the source of infection, test them, treat them in hospital if needed and, otherwise, ensure they’re self-isolating for 14 days. Even jurisdictions in the U.S. are struggling to meet these basics.

Communications from public-health officials in Canada have been steady, transparent, and reliable. In times of uncertainty, trust is key.

In order to maintain trust, Canada's public-health system needs to be better funded over the long haul. In the short term, expect pressure on the federal and provincial governments to respond to the dual crisis of COVID-19 and oil sell-off with major stimulus initiatives.

Economists are already talking about the need to ""supersize"" refundable tax credits like the GST or the Canada Child Benefit, to get cash in the hands of those who need it. But this is also a moment to correct the chronic underfunding of public-health units across Canada.

If we manage to contain COVID-19, it will be because of individual efforts to follow public-health protocols and because of the expertise of public-health officials in quickly establishing those protocols.

These are our strongest links in the system. Let's invest in keeping them strong."""
Tyee,Shut Out: How Families Have Fallen Off the Housing Ladder,https://thetyee.ca/News/2020/05/14/Families-Falling-Off-Housing-Ladder/,Most partisan bias,,"Fair interpretations of the news
",,"In 2005, Tom Lancaster and his wife bought a 510-square-foot, one-bedroom townhouse in East Vancouver.

It’s the latest in our series of Zoom get-togethers with Tyee folks.

Three years later they were starting to plan to have kids and wanted to move to a bigger place. At the same time, the bubbly Vancouver housing market was starting to turn down in the wake of a housing market meltdown in the United States.

So Lancaster and his wife sold, feeling fortunate to have come out ahead, and brought their first child home to a rented basement suite while they tried to figure out their next move.

Two years and two evictions later their family had grown to four with the birth of their son, and the Lancasters had had enough of Vancouver’s rental market. They decided to try to become homeowners again.

“We scraped together the cash that we had and put a down payment on a house,” said Lancaster, who works as a community planner.

“And it was the biggest money pit.”

The house in East Vancouver wasn’t fancy or big, but it was gobbling up all the money Lancaster and his wife had.

“It was the cheapest of all single-family houses on the market at the time,” Lancaster said. “It was a tear down.”

With his wife, a teacher, staying home to look after their two young children for two years, the couple found themselves scraping by on one income and struggling to make the mortgage payments. They decided to sell the house and buy something cheaper, like a townhouse or a condo.

But by then it was 2016 and prices were skyrocketing. Lancaster and his wife accepted an offer and sold the money pit. But while they waited for the actual closing date, prices jumped by around 30 per cent in their East Vancouver neighbourhood.

They were never able to buy again. Today they rent a house near Fraser Street in East Vancouver.

Falling off the housing ladder

Once a young Canadian couple gets a foothold on the housing ladder — a small “starter” house or condo — they’re supposed to be able to steadily climb upwards, moving to bigger digs as their family grows, and steadily adding to a home equity nest egg that will pay off once they get to retirement age.

But in Vancouver some people have fallen right off the ladder, while many others can’t figure out how to get on it in the first place. Housing prices have risen so far beyond average incomes that it takes a big extra boost — a financial gift from family, often using a parent’s or grandparent’s Vancouver-area home equity — to get on the first rung of the ladder.

“Back in the 1970s... it took the typical young person five years of full-time work to save a 20-per-cent down payment on the average-priced home,” said Paul Kershaw, a professor at the University of British Columbia’s School of Population and Public Health.

Today it takes the average Canadian 13 years to save enough, said Kershaw, who is also the founder of Generation Squeeze, a lobby group for younger generations of Canadians.

In Ontario, that number rises to 15 years, and for B.C., it’s 19 years. If you’re trying to buy into the Greater Toronto Area, it would take you 21 years to save enough money. But Metro Vancouver tops them all: it now takes 29 years of full-time work to save a 20-per-cent down payment.

Vancouver housing prices soared after 2000, making owning a home an impossible dream for most first-time buyers.
A country ‘drunk on housing’

University of Toronto professor David Hulchanski has tracked how Canadian government housing programs since the end of the Second World War have focused on boosting homeownership.

The federal and provincial governments created mortgage lending and insurance institutions, while municipal governments provided land and zoning to build “relatively cheap housing in postwar subdivisions,” Hulchanski wrote in a 2007 paper.

“Since the early 1970s, a steady stream of house purchase assistance programs has helped maintain Canada’s ownership rate at about two-thirds.”

The federal government created the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. in 1946, and the new agency “focused public funds almost exclusively on the ownership sector,” according to Hulchanski.

The federal government did step up efforts to provide subsidized rental housing for low-income Canadians in the early 1960s, building 200,000 units of public housing between 1963 and the mid-1970s with provincial and community partners.

Around the same time, federal tax breaks also fuelled a rental housing boom in Canadian cities.

But the social housing building boom came to an end in the early 1990s, when the federal government decided to get out of housing altogether — except when it came to homeownership.

Throughout the 1990s and 2000s CMHC focused primarily on insuring mortgages, and many federal and provincial budgets contained tax exemptions, credits or other benefits for homeowners, especially first-time buyers. One of the biggest giveaways to homeowners, an exemption on paying capital gains tax on the sale of a principal residence, has been in place since 1972.

By the mid-2000s, Hulchanski notes, CMHC was helping homeowners at a vastly higher rate than it aided poor people who were having trouble paying their rent. For instance, he says, CMHC reported it had provided mortgage insurance to 746,157 homeowners in 2005 alone, compared to the 633,300 social housing units it had funded in the past 35 years.

Canada was not alone in its focus on encouraging and subsidizing homeownership — many countries, including the United States, crafted policies designed to help people become homeowners. But in the wake of the 2008 U.S. financial crisis, which was triggered by a massive boom and bust in housing prices, experts and policy makers started to question the assumption that homeownership should always be the goal.

Today the head of CMHC, Evan Siddall, is relaying a much different message. Build more purpose-built rental — a lot of it. And stop peddling the idea that homeownership is “the only path to financial security.” He’s warned that in “supply constrained markets” like Vancouver and Toronto, measures to help people become homeowners only increase the price of housing.

“Well-intentioned support for home buyers often proves to have the opposite effect by making affordability worse, merely adding to existing homeowners’ wealth at the expense of younger Canadians,” he wrote in the agency’s 2018 annual report.

In remarks at a Feb. 13 event in Vancouver, Siddall summed up the city’s place in Canada’s housing continuum: “In a country that’s drunk on housing,” he said, “Vancouver is our No. 1 distillery.”

But the COVID-19 crisis has shown how CMHC is still set up to help homeowners quickly, but not renters. In response to the economic fallout, CMHC quickly announced it would support mortgage deferrals on March 13.

Siddall acknowledged the agency isn’t set up to provide the same immediate help to renters: “We actually don’t have an easy way to get support to renters quickly,” he wrote to The Tyee in March.

Instead, it’s been provincial governments that have acted to support renters, with eviction bans or extra financial support.

The best laid plans

Vancouver’s housing market dipped slightly in response to the 2008 financial crisis — but the last 20 years have been a period of enormous gains for existing homeowners.

851px version of AffordabilityIndexGraph.jpg
Soaring Vancouver real estate prices left first-time buyers on the sidelines.
For residents trying to enter the market for the first time, or get back in, it was a different story.

Those who saved carefully for years could have their plans thrown awry by skyrocketing prices — or by unexpected events, like the addition of a new family member.

That’s what happened to Stefania Seccia and her husband, who cobbled together a down payment to buy a pre-sale condo in New Westminster in 2016. They used their savings and money that friends and family gave as wedding presents, and had just enough to pay a deposit and set aside a down payment for a $375,900 one-bedroom apartment in a project near Sapperton SkyTrain station.

The one-bedroom was all they could afford, and because Seccia and her husband had difficulty conceiving, they didn’t expect to have children any time soon. But that changed in 2018, when their son Max was born — a surprise, but a very welcome one.

Now the condo is almost complete and Seccia and her husband are trying to decide what to do. They currently live in a two-bedroom apartment in a housing co-op in Burnaby, and don’t really want to downsize to a one-bedroom with a toddler, a dog and a cat — especially now, with both parents working from home and taking care of Max because of COVID-19 restrictions.

But they also can’t sell and attempt to buy a bigger place right away, because they would have to pay capital gains tax on the sale of the brand-new condo. And while their one-bedroom condo has gone up in value, so have bigger units.

Seccia said she’s been advised she can move into the condo for six months and then sell in order to qualify for the capital gains tax exemption.

Financial uncertainties wrought by COVID-19 have also crept in. Seccia and her husband were recently approved for their mortgage, but they had to assure their bank that their jobs were “COVID-proof.” The approval is only in place until July, so they’re hoping the building will be complete before then.

The mortgage approval came as a huge relief, because if they hadn’t qualified they feared losing their pre-sale deposit.

But even with all the moving parts and hard decisions, owning their own home still seems like the only way to really ensure stability for the future.

“Anything can happen — a few years ago there was a problem with the federal government, whether or not they’d renew the [co-op’s] mortgage,” Seccia said.

“We just see homeownership as a way to secure our future. I kind of hate that that dream seems so unrealistic.”

The future of real estate

Starting in 2016, the federal and B.C. governments introduced new taxes and other measures to slow down real estate speculation and rapid price increases. Vancouver’s white-hot real estate market rapidly cooled in response. The slowdown was particularly significant for the highest-priced real estate in the market: the luxury condos of Yaletown and the West End, and single family homes in West Vancouver and Vancouver’s west side.

But in the first few months of 2020 it looked like real estate was again on the upswing, especially for the lower-priced part of the market.

Now with COVID-19 affecting every part of the global economy, it’s anyone’s guess. In March the BC Real Estate Association predicted home sales and prices would decline in the spring and early summer, “but should recover along with the wider economy in the second half of the year, contingent on the outbreak resolving.”

Others suspect the economic impact will be wider and long-lasting. Three million jobs were lost in March and April, Canada’s borders are still closed to non-essential travel and many prospective homebuyers are no longer able to get a mortgage because they’ve been laid off or work in a vulnerable industry.

Steve Saretsky, a realtor in Vancouver, said one of his clients was ready to put in an offer on a townhouse in late March. But when Saretsky followed up the next day, the buyer said he’d been laid off.

“I think a lot of people initially thought their job was safe,” Saretsky said.

Saretsky had a warning for the many Metro Vancouver residents who have been waiting for prices to fall so they can finally get into the market — not so fast. New condos are still being completed and unsold inventory is building, which should push prices down.

But he questioned how many buyers will qualify for a mortgage in the coming months.

“I just get the sense that everyone’s thinking, ‘I’m going to buy the dip, like this is my opportunity,’” Saretsky said. “Prices take a while to come down.”

“I just think people aren’t quantifying the economic destruction.”

Based on previous policy decisions, Saretsky expects senior levels of government will intervene to prevent housing prices from falling too far.

There are several policy tools the federal government could use, Saretsky said, like allowing longer mortgage amortizations or easing a mortgage stress test put in place in 2018 to make sure homeowners could weather adverse financial conditions.

With prices in Vancouver staying stubbornly high, can first-time buyers expect to be able to get into the market?

Shelly Smee, a realtor with Oakwyn Realty in Vancouver, said it’s still possible, but challenging. First-time buyers probably need to be on a high-earning career track and to have been saving for a down payment since their 20s, she said.

Most are also getting significant financial help from parents or grandparents, who are using their own home equity to help their kids.

Smee said around 70 per cent of the first-time buyers she works with today are in their late 30s.

“If you didn’t have a plan for your life in your early 20s, and you didn’t have the education or you didn’t get on a career path to earn some money, then yeah, it becomes very difficult in your 30s and 40s to realize that the market’s just kept going up,” Smee said.

Benjamin Tal, an economist at CIBC, said the Vancouver market went through “a very healthy correction” in 2018 and 2019.

But Tal doesn’t believe the city will ever again have affordable real estate prices. Instead, he says, residents who want to stay will have to come to terms with being life-long renters.

“I think that homeownership in Canada and in Vancouver in particular probably has reached its peak,” he said. “I don’t think people will be able to afford buying houses to the extent that they used to, and therefore you will see a situation where more people look for other opportunities.

“And you will see families renting, and that’s actually the future of real estate.”

Renting forever is hard to accept

To Seccia and Lancaster, that’s a hard pill to swallow. Both make solidly middle-class incomes. Seccia and her husband have lived frugally in the suburbs for years, putting up with a punishing daily commute.

“We keep getting told, if you climb the ladder, if you keep making more money, your situation will get better,” she said.

Lancaster said he sometimes feels like he’s failing to provide properly for his children. When he looks around his Kensington-Cedar Cottage neighbourhood, he sees multiple houses owned by one person — or houses owned by people who got hundreds of thousands of dollars in financial help from their parents — and it just doesn’t seem fair.

“All these other [families] are going to leave a multimillion home to their kids later on, and we’re going to leave our kids — hopefully — a place to rent,” he said.

Despite the economists’ mantra that building more housing will push prices down — or prevent them from rising further — Seccia believes that “high density developments are what’s causing prices to go up.”

Density has been steadily increasing, she said, with no impact on prices.

Lancaster supports measures aimed at reducing speculation, like Vancouver’s empty homes tax. But he’d also like to see more housing built everywhere — including in traditionally single-family home neighbourhoods.

“We need to build lots of rentals and lots of stuff to buy,” he said. “My neighbourhood is undergoing dramatic change and I love it.”

He’d also like to see the gap between homeowners and renters narrowed.

“I feel that housing is a human right and we live in cities where people are getting incredibly rich off of holding land and holding housing,” he said.

“The disparity between the people who own and those who rent is just so stark to us right now, it’s amazing.”"
Post Millennial,Insane article promotes coronavirus as a force to fight climate change,https://thepostmillennial.com/insane-article-promotes-coronavirus-as-a-force-to-fight-climate-change,Most partisan bias,,Unfair interpretations of the news:,,"In a new, blisteringly white-hot take called “Coronavirus can trigger a new industrial revolution,” a very super smart guy who knows better than us named Ed Conway explains how the coronavirus has an upside: “Unlike most other such diseases, it kills mostly the old who, let’s face it, are more likely to be climate sceptics. It spares the young. Most of all, it stymies the forces that have been generating greenhouse gases for decades.”

This is a shocking display of hubris, looking intense, life-ending natural disaster in the face, and saying “hey, maybe it’s not so bad.” To a certain extent, we’ve been waiting for this to happen. It was inevitable. After years of alarmism and dangerous fetishization, we’ve reached the moment in our current age of hysteria and panic where a major publication is publishing an ode to a potentially cataclysmic pathogen because the side effects will be a lowering of carbon emissions and the death of the type of people who don’t consider that a priority.

Quarantines due to the viral outbreak have put the breaks on manufacturing in Wuhan, China, the locus of the outbreak. Images released by NASA show a sharp decline in nitrogen dioxide levels as millions of people have gone into quarantine and assembly lines have ground to a halt. People aren’t working or engaging in life outside their homes. The result is a decline in pollution levels.

“On the one hand that spells enormous disruption and could make all our lives more expensive,” Conway writes of the coronavirus. “Yet there is also a silver lining which need not only appeal to Extinction Rebellion. What if this is the nudge we need to embrace a new model of globalisation?”

It’s obvious that a sharp decrease in manufacturing drops emissions. When human beings stop being their naturally industrious productive selves, the earth and its other forms of life fill in the gaps. Extinction Rebellion, Greta Thunberg, and extreme climate activists are fond of letting us know just how terrible human beings are.

But is this really what we want? Wuhan has been a major player in Chinese manufacturing but is now barely recognizable.


The decline in manufacturing and disruption of supply chains gives progressive climate change extremists something of a proof of concept. Conway’s idea for what life will look like after the virus has had its way for us is even more depressing that high pollution levels.

“For the dirty secret about today’s economy is that it is actually a product of yesterday’s technologies: the foundation of just-in-time supply chains is software and internet connectivity. The ultimate energy source is fossil fuels, in ships and planes. Today’s new technologies — 3D printing, AI, robotics — could enable a very different form of globalization. Combine them and it is possible, as the economist Richard Baldwin says, to imagine hotel rooms in London being cleaned by robots controlled by cleaners in Poland, or lawns in Texas mowed by robots steered by gardeners in Mexico.”

What is being proposed here is that people become more isolated physically, more interconnected technologically, and further removed from each other and the world outside their locality than before. If we spent the 20th century getting together and learning each other’s customs in person, feeling the air and ground of new places, the idea now is that we spend the 21st century stuck behind a fence of fear in our own backyards.

It is true that the COVID 19 virus is most likely to kill the elderly and the sick. But to take that fact and flip it as a positive because those lives somehow mean less than others is depraved and disgusting.

“The chimneys which once belched smog into the skies of Beijing and Shenzhen are smoking no more … The coronavirus is one of those shocks that could force business to take the leaps they were hitherto too nervous to make.” Conway croons as he casually suggests that this outcome may be worth losing a large percentage of our most vulnerable loved ones.

The old and the sick are human beings. But in his article, Conway is suggesting it’s somehow worth losing them because they are more likely to be guilty of wrongthink. It’s as though he’s advocating for a kind of ideological eugenics based on the sick, woke views that he and his elite colleagues constantly try to enforce. If the non-conforming boomers can’t be made to see reason, is the idea, perhaps we’ll just get lucky and they’ll die off sooner than life expectancy would indicate.

Extreme activists would have us believe that the preservation of the world and the reversal of climate change is more important than anything else, from personal international travel to global trade, but when the effects are seen in action like this, it’s hard to argue that people matter less than the planet.

Saving the earth at the cost of the population is not a good goal, and those activists that decry humanity in the name of saving the world need to realize that human life and human progress are not negotiable. Humanity needs to innovate in service to the needs of human beings, not for some glorified fantasy of human isolation.

While the climate crisis needs to be dealt with, it isn’t through ramping down human activity that we will be successful, but in trusting human ingenuity and strength to figure out new energy sources that can provide greater power at less cost to humanity and the planet.

People matter. All people. The young, old, sick, healthy, woke and redpilled. The practically pathogenic dehumanization that Conway is practising must be rejected at all costs."
True North New,Offenders charged with violent crimes to be released from prison over COVID-19 risk,https://tnc.news/2020/04/08/offenders-charged-with-violent-crimes-to-be-released-from-prison-over-covid-19-risk/,Most partisan bias,,Unfair interpretations of the news:,,"Judges have been freeing dangerous offenders into the public due to the coronavirus pandemic. 

As reported on by Global News, several criminals who were in custody for violent offences were recently released. 

One man, identified only as T.K. in court records, was freed with conditions despite having a long criminal history with 23 convictions to his name. T.K. was being held at the time on drug trafficking charges. 

In the decision, the judge cited a report that revealed the inmates were susceptible to the coronavirus due to the cramped and confined prison environment.


19-year-old Kaynadid Abshir, who allegedly participated in a Toronto driveby shooting as a getaway driver, was also released from custody. 

Abshir was set to face several charges including attempted murder, aggravated assault, and numerous firearms offences. The judge cited Abshir’s “circumstantial” case, mental health issues, and clean record as the reasons behind his release.  

In another decision, alleged “drug supplier” Brandon Cain was released from the Ottawa Carleton Detention Centre despite facing “serious charges from a violent attack.” 

Cain and others were alleged to have assaulted victims with a pistol and taser, and also “forcing the complainants to shoplift in order to pay off the drug debt for the stolen drugs,” according to a ruling by the Superior Court. 

Cain was released on $11,000 in bonds and house arrest, even though he violated the conditions of his prior bail release which forced police to take him back into custody. 

Another man identified as T.L. in court documents was released after requesting to live with his grandparents. 

T.L. was alleged to have been involved in a Sept. 30, 2019 shooting that resulted in injuries. According to the court records, T.L. provided the weapon in the shooting and used his own vehicle to help the shooter flee the scene. 

“The offence is a very serious one,” wrote the judge. 

“The shooter is charged with attempted murder. Mr. L. is charged with having aided that. He is also charged with having provided the weapon.” 

In the decision to order T.L’s release the judge referred to the “unique circumstances” regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and that it was difficult to determine when the accused’s trial would begin. "

The airline hopes to ramp up operations in coming months, but even optimistic estimates put late-2020 airline travel volume at about one-quarter of baseline levels.

Similar patterns are playing out everywhere. COVID-19 has decimated the travel industry. It will return, of course, but will it be the same as we remember it?

My pre-boomer peers are almost all retirees, many securely well-heeled, and mad for travel. In their salad days, they planned trips hither and yon by themselves or with friends. The food tour through Italy, or the wine tour through France. Bicycles and hiking often were involved, along with local guides who would provide a deep dive into regional culture and history. No wasting away at Del Boca Vista for this set. Even the least ambitious will sign on to group trips, with age-appropriate itineraries and accommodations managed by experts. Cruises are much favoured. In 2019, an estimated 30 million passengers per year traveled the high seas.

My husband and I are neither of us tinctured with the wanderlust that afflicts so many of our friends. And yet, a little embarrassed at having seen so little of the world, we took to cruising many years ago as a compromise between our comfortable beaten path (Quebec cottage country, New England, Florida) and the more serious itinerary-driven travel that our peers gush about on Facebook.

Amongst the pleasures provided by these floating palaces, apart from the bliss of unpacking only once for the duration, is the relaxing assumption that one is safe from the kind of unpleasant surprises real travelers stoically surmount on their roads less travelled—a scorpion at one’s toes in the scenic wilds of Costa Rica slipper, say, or the poisonous barb of some hideous thing lurking under the waves at a remote coastal beach. Plus, of course, the enchantment of awakening each day to a new, exotic port of call.

On a Black Sea cruise, I lighted on Varna, Yalta, and Odessa. A few hours in each, including a close inspection of the very hall in the czar’s summer palace where the Allied leaders met in 1945, and I was back on the boat, satisfied that I’d gotten a general sense of the place and its importance. The curators at Livadia Palace had even decked out the meeting hall in a way that corresponded to famous photos of the Yalta Conference. No, I didn’t learn much more information about any of these places than might be contained in the small-print caption information on a postcard. But getting the overall historical gist of the place is fine for me, as it is for most of the cruising demographic. I am sure Istanbul would occupy any serious traveler for at least a week. But for voyaging wastrels like us, a few palaces, the Blue Mosque and the Grand Bazaar, with vendors clutching at one’s arm and attempting to drag one into their leather-goods shops, were quite enough.

But now the words “cruise ship” conjure up the Diamond Princess, on which about a fifth of the ship’s 3,711 passengers and crew became infected with COVID-19 in January. At least nine died. Several other cruise ships became COVID-19 hot-spots as well, demonstrating the ease with which the virus could spread in a confined space—especially a confined space whose very purpose is to facilitate collective meals, recreation, gambling, drinking, and assorted merrymaking. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the average age of the Diamond Princess passengers was 69, certainly old enough to be in a high-risk category for COVID-19. Even in February, before lockdown measures in most countries began in earnest, my traveling friends were rightly terrified by news that this massive ship had become one giant floating quarantine station.

One must never underestimate the public’s penchant for amnesia. The 1977 Norwalk gastroenteritis outbreak, which affected more than 500 passengers on multiple cruises, put a temporary damper on cruising for a while. But it picked up again, despite the fact that the virus still recurs from time to time. (As recently as 2019, a Royal Caribbean cruise was cut short when hundreds were sickened.) Noroviruses aren’t typically fatal, though I guarantee that anyone who gets Norwalk won’t forget the experience soon.

But this amnesia has its limits. And so I offer my prediction that—absent a foolproof vaccine, of the type we have for measles—COVID-19 will deal the big ships a knockout blow. Even once the lockdown policies end, oldies will continue voluntarily to observe far stricter semi-isolation rules than everyone else. It’s simply a matter of cost-benefit analysis. Yes, the pleasurable benefits we enjoy on the lido deck are somewhat greater than those that would be experienced by the average millennial hipster (though he might still derive some fleeting pleasure in a purely ironic capacity). But the statistically calculated costs would be much higher, since there is a good chance that COVID-19 would be fatal for me, but likely present as little more than a mild flu for someone half my age.

As with many of the changes that COVID-19 will bring about—including the retail migration to Amazon and the trend of people working from home—this may be a case of simply accelerating something that would have come about anyway. Every new generation is more sensitive to environmental issues than the one before. And cruise ships gobble obscene amounts of fuel, and can directly or indirectly befoul some of the most beautiful places on Earth. They also happen to be floating dens of all-you-can-eat gluttony that sometimes resemble a fattening farm run by Kang and Kodos. Even before COVID-19, cruising already was seen as a politically incorrect, white-privilege, “Ok, boomer” form of indulgence. We live in an age when even many grandparents follow social media and know the derisive cruise memes from Seinfeld et cetera. They were willing to suffer the stigma associated with cruising for the sake of the attendant pleasures. But add on the threat of respiratory failure and you can bet they’ll opt instead for a socially isolated bike tour with Butterfield & Robinson.

The demise of big-ship cruising should not be regretted, even if my own memories are fond. And the ships themselves could be repurposed in permanent dockage as time-share condos. Fort Lauderdale in our winter one year, Sydney in Australia’s summer the next. True, you’ll never be able to step off in Yalta to gaze upon the room where Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt planned the architecture of the post-war world. But at the end of the day, a room is just a room, just as a beach is just a beach. As Wikipedia attests, Allied leaders had the foresight to snap their own selfies back in 1945. In the post-COVID-19 world, I’m really not sure how many of us will be risking infection to snap our own."
APTN,Jurisdictional limbo’ left Metis in Saskatchewan unprepared for COVID-19 says MNC spokesperson,https://www.aptnnews.ca/national-news/jurisdictional-limbo-left-metis-in-saskatchewan-unprepared-for-covid-19-says-mnc-spokesperson/,Possible Skew,,"Fair interpretations of the news
",,"Metis villages in northern Saskatchewan with rising COVID-19 cases are in “jurisdictional limbo” between federal and provincial governments that left them underprepared for the coronavirus pandemic, according to Metis National Council (MNC) spokesperson David Chartrand.

“There was no plan, no supports, no programs, no supply chain, nothing, because both governments are saying, ‘No, it’s not my jurisdiction. It’s yours.’,” Chartrand told the Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs (INAN), which met virtually to discuss the pandemic’s impact on Indigenous communities.

“Both are still blaming each other, and [COVID-19’s] still creeping into the next villages now because families are taking it to the next villages not realizing they’re carrying it.”

First Nations Inuit Health Branch (FNIHB) which is under Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) provides on-reserve health-care services for First Nations as well as Inuit in the territories but throughout the pandemic has said Metis communities are under provincial jurisdiction.

But Chartrand says the province passes responsibility back to Ottawa.

“At the provincial level, despite our staggering chronic illnesses, the province tells us to deal with the federal government to deal [with] our unique health-care conditions and needs. Our pandemic plans have been limited to providing income and food supports,” he said.

According to the Incident Command Centre (ICC) in northwestern Saskatchewan, 146 people had tested positive for the novel coronavirus in the municipalities of Beauval, La Loche, Buffalo Narrows, Ile-a-la-Crosse and Jans Bay as of May 7.

“Those are all Metis villages,” Chartrand said.

According to ISC, there were 168 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on First Nations reserves in the provinces.

As numbers rise in the regions surrounding La Loche and Beauval, municipalities in the region may soon have more cases of COVID-19 than all First Nations reserves in the country combined.

Clearwater River Dene Nation, which is next to La Loche, has reported 16 confirmed cases.

“Just for those of you that do not know, the Metis community of Western Canada, nearly every reserve, you’ll find a Metis village next door to it,” he told the committee.

Though Clearwater has a smaller population, Chartrand attributed the disparity in numbers to the fact that First Nations had pandemic plans through FNIHB while adjacent Metis villages were caught in a “dark zone” between jurisdictions.

“Our pandemic plan has been limited by our lack of access to Metis health-care services. despite all research that shows how important it is to have culturally competent and safe health-care, Metis have been shut out of the provincial and federal health-care systems,” he said.



(Rick Laliberte is calling for a Treaty 10 pandemic council in northwestern Saskatchewan, which AFN National Chief Perry Bellegarde urged the committee to support.)

Chartrand also said that Metis municipalities don’t have access to ISC’s federal stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE), which the government says is shipped to First Nations communities within 24 hours.

“None of this was distributed to the Metis community,” Chartrand said, adding that Manitoba Metis purchased PPE from China instead.

“When these stockpiles are taking place in Canada, I’m sad to say a leader that it’s not inclusive of us. We have nothing. We don’t get one mask. We don’t get one band-aid, let’s put it that way.”

Metis did receive help through the federal government’s Indigenous Community Support Fund, which Chartrand said was greatly appreciated.

“The $30 million is enabling the MNC’s governing members or provincial affiliates to provide the immediate supports for Metis Nation citizens, families and seniors. They have developed and are rolling out action plans providing immediate supports such as food, income, supplies and rent supplements,” he said.

“At the same time, the health emergency has opposed the particular vulnerability and disadvantage of the 400,000-strong Metis Nation population. It is highlighted by the distressing fact that neither level of government has taken responsibility to address the deep-seated health conditions of the Metis people in Canada,” he added.

While Metis communities in Saskatchewan have been hit hard, Manitoba has yet to confirm a case of COVID-19 in First Nations or Metis communities.

Rick Laliberte, the incident commander coordinating northwestern Saskatchewan’s pandemic response, told APTN News the ICC was formed in part because local First Nations leaders were pulling their pandemic plans off the shelves but municipalities had “no such plan.”

He later called for the creation of a Treaty 10 pandemic council that would include Metis leaders, First Nations chiefs and municipal mayors.

On multiple occasions as the committee hearing progressed, AFN National Chief Perry Bellegarde encouraged Ottawa to get behind the idea of a more integrated response.

“Support the Treaty 10 pandemic plan that Rick Laliberte and all the mayors and the chiefs are working on together,” he said.

“Support that.”

As numbers rose in northwestern Saskatchewan, both Ottawa and Regina started sending additional material and human resources, personal protective equipment (PPE), and point-of-care rapid testing equipment.

Bellegarde and Chartrand urged federal and provincial governments to set jurisdictional disputes aside and work together during the public health emergency"
National Observer,Employers readying for reopening worry about second wave of COVID-19,https://www.nationalobserver.com/2020/05/25/news/employers-readying-reopening-worry-about-second-wave-covid-19,Possible Skew,,Quality News,,"Chef Kreg Graham says he's been doing a lot of thinking about washing dishes now that some COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted and he can start serving meals again.

The executive chef at the Victoria-area Oak Bay Beach Hotel said much of the time he's spending in the kitchen preparing for a restart has been on safety protocols, not the menu.

""We've been doing a lot of research and brainstorming on how we can safely operate in the kitchen in tight spaces,"" Graham said in an interview. ""Everyone understands we live in a different world now and there's a lot of work to be done to make sure everyone's safe.""

The British Columbia government lifted operating restrictions placed on restaurants, pubs and some personal and health services, including hair stylists and dentists, on May 19 after a successful effort at slowing the spread on the novel coronavirus.

Despite being closed since March or limited to take out, curbside and delivery services, many businesses took the week to fine tune their safety plans to protect customers and employees before reopening.

Graham said ensuring a safe dishwashing area became one of his greatest concerns.

""Probably the most vulnerable area in any kitchen right now is the dishwashing area,"" he said. ""As the plates and cutlery and glasses come back into the kitchen, we are being very careful to minimize any contamination to the dishwasher personnel and the other things in the area. Every plate, spoon, fork, glass is being soaked in a sanitizing bath before being put into the dishwasher.""

Graham said when the kitchen is operating at full capacity, the hotel employs 25 people, but he doesn't expect to see that number until the fall, depending on the state of the virus.

A recent Conference Board of Canada survey found most employers are not fully prepared to bring employees back to work, with many concerned about worker and customer safety and the potential impact of a second wave of COVID-19.

The survey found only eight per cent of employers were fully prepared to restart operations, while 40 per cent were close to being prepared and the remaining 52 per cent were only somewhat ready, said Allison Cowan, the board's director of human capital research.

""What we heard is most employers are bringing people back in phases,"" she said in an interview from Ottawa. ""Ultimately, when it comes to bringing workers back to the workplace this needs to be done carefully and responsibly. Safety is paramount and the virus will likely find loopholes in safety measures we put in place.""

Employers worry about safety, cash flow, second wave in COVID-19 restart
Bridgitte Anderson, president of Greater Vancouver Board of Trade, said businesses are worried they won't survive if customers don't return.

""Without revenues coming back to where they were, there's just going to be some unfortunate outcomes,"" said Anderson in an interview. ""This continued new normal is likely going to continue on through the summer for sure and into the fall. This is a very gradual recovery and unfortunately that brings along with it a lot of pain.""

A survey of more than 1,300 member businesses by the board, the B.C. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Council of B.C. found just 26 per cent believe they can open and operate profitably with the gradual easing of COVID-19 restrictions.

The survey also found 75 per cent of businesses worry about attracting customers.

""I would say the business community is under incredible pressure over the next several months as we enter more into this reopening phase,"" Anderson said.

The B.C. government said Friday it would allow pubs, restaurants and other businesses in the hospitality sector to apply to temporarily expand their service areas to outside patios to enlarge their footprint."
Le Devoir,Il existe deux branches de coronavirus depuis le début de la pandémie,https://www.ledevoir.com/societe/science/579596/il-existe-deux-branches-de-coronavirus-depuis-le-debut-de-la-pandemie,Possible Skew,,Quality News,,"Le coronavirus responsable de la pandémie de COVID-19 évolue lentement, mais les multiples mutations qu’il a subies depuis qu’il s’attaque à l’humain n’ont jusqu’à maintenant en rien modifié son caractère pathogène, souligne une étude publiée dans la revue Nature. Cette publication confirme également que deux grandes lignées génétiques distinctes de SRAS-CoV-2 sont à l’origine de la pandémie, dont seulement l’une des deux aurait été contractée par des humains dans un marché public de Wuhan, en Chine.

La pandémie de COVID-19 a émergé à Wuhan, vraisemblablement dans un marché de fruits de mer, plus précisément dans le Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Toutefois, le fait qu’un nombre considérable de cas initiaux de COVID-19 n’ont pas eu de contacts avec ce marché jette un doute sur le contexte particulier qui a permis au coronavirus de passer de l’animal à l’humain.

Pour éclaircir cette question, une équipe de chercheurs de Shanghai, en Chine, a analysé et comparé les génomes des coronavirus dont étaient infectés 94 habitants de Shanghai atteints de la COVID-19 et ceux de 221 échantillons de SRAS-CoV-2 qui étaient accessibles sur la plateforme de partage de données GISAID. Ces scientifiques ont ainsi pu identifier deux clades majeurs, c’est-à-dire deux grands groupes phylogénétiques de coronavirus distincts ayant un même ancêtre commun. Ils ont également remarqué que les coronavirus dépistés chez les premières personnes ayant reçu un diagnostic de COVID-19, début décembre, appartenaient dans certains cas au clade I et dans d’autres cas au clade II.

Plus précisément, ils ont constaté que le génome des virus prélevés chez six patients ayant fréquenté le Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market de Wuhan était associé au clade I, alors que celui de trois autres patients ayant été testés durant la même période, mais qui n’avaient pas été en contact avec le marché de Wuhan, faisait partie du clade II.

Selon les auteurs de l’article de Nature, ces deux clades caractérisés par un profil génétique particulier « représentent vraisemblablement deux lignées issues d’un ancêtre commun, mais qui ont évolué indépendamment au début décembre à Wuhan ; l’une d’elles, celle du clade I, se serait disséminée dans le marché public, où la grande densité d’étals, de vendeurs et de consommateurs a pu faciliter la transmission d’humain à humain, l’autre se serait propagée au départ chez des gens qui n’avaient pas eu de contacts avec le marché. « Cela ne veut donc pas dire que le virus serait passé de l’animal à l’humain au marché, car l’étude montre que ces deux lignées avaient un ancêtre commun », souligne la Dre Cécile Tremblay, infectiologue au CHUM.

En concordance avec cette hypothèse, des investigations épidémiologiques menées sur les tout premiers cas de COVID-19 apparus à Wuhan avant le 18 décembre ont révélé que deux patients avaient eu des contacts avec le Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market tandis que cinq autres n’avaient aucun lien avec ce marché.

L’analyse phylogénétique de ces deux clades suggère aussi que l’événement zoonotique le plus ancien, c’est-à-dire celui de la transmission de l’animal à l’humain, serait probablement survenu en novembre 2019. Les chercheurs seraient parvenus à cette hypothèse en raison « du peu de diversité dans la phylogénie générale du SRAS-CoV-2, tel que révélé par l’horloge moléculaire ».

« Dans des virus, comme l’influenza et le VIH, qui ont une longue histoire évolutive chez l’humain, on voit plus de variabilité, car les mutations se sont accumulées avec le temps, alors que dans le SRAS-CoV-2, il y a relativement peu de diversité, ce qui est compatible avec une histoire récente chez l’humain. La date de novembre pourrait être précisée avec plus de données, mais en fonction de nos connaissances actuelles, cette date est plausible », explique Jesse Shapiro, titulaire de la Chaire de recherche du Canada en génomique microbienne révolutionnaire, à l’Université de Montréal.

« Cet événement zoonotique survenu en novembre aurait donc produit l’ancêtre commun qui aurait évolué en ces deux lignées, dont l’une s’est retrouvée parmi les gens qui fréquentaient le marché de Wuhan, et l’autre s’est transmise ailleurs. On ne connaît donc pas non plus où est apparue la souche ancestrale capable de se transmettre d’humain à humain », ajoute la Dre Tremblay.

Également, les chercheurs ont comparé les génomes des virus ayant été prélevés sur 112 personnes atteintes de la COVID-19, à Shanghai, entre le 20 janvier et le 25 février, à ceux des virus portés par les premières personnes infectées par le SRAS-CoV-2, à Wuhan. Ils ont ainsi pu observer que le génome du virus continuait d’évoluer, comme en témoignent les 169 variations génétiques décelées dans neuf régions du génome impliquées dans la synthèse de protéines. Ces petites variations n’ont toutefois pas modifié les manifestations cliniques du virus. C’est pourquoi les auteurs de l’étude concluent que « l’évolution du génome du coronavirus est stable ».

« Comme tous les virus, le SRAS-CoV-2 continue d’évoluer, et il continuera de subir des mutations, mais jusqu’à maintenant, il n’y a aucune preuve que les mutations survenues dans son génome ont eu un impact sur ses caractéristiques adaptatives, notamment sur son aptitude à se transmettre et sur la sévérité de la maladie qu’il induit. L’évolution du virus est stable dans le sens où elle n’a pas abouti à des souches qui ont des manifestations cliniques différentes », précise M. Shapiro.

« Les chercheurs n’ont trouvé aucune association entre les mutations qu’ils ont observées dans le virus affectant les 112 patients et les manifestations cliniques de ces mêmes patients. Cela ne veut toutefois pas dire qu’avec un plus grand échantillon de données, on ne trouvera pas d’effets. Il est également possible que surviennent éventuellement des mutations qui changeront les caractéristiques du virus, et pour cette raison, il est important de continuer à faire ce genre de surveillance », souligne-t-il."

“We’re still learning about how #COVID19 affects animals, but it appears that people can spread the virus to animals in some situations,” said the CDC’s Twitter account, @CDCgov.

In their key points, the CDC said while the exact source of COVID-19 is unknown, “we know that it originally came from an animal source.”

The agency also said “there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19″ so that, based on the limited information, “the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.”

The CDC also says some coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, infect only animals and not infect humans.

The first U.S case of an animal testing positive for COVID-19 was a tiger at the Bronx Zoo and he was believed to have gotten it from an infected zookeeper."

The ferry service says there will be four round-trip sailings every day starting June 3.

Sailings will operate at 50 per cent capacity for passengers and BC Ferries recommends reserving a spot ahead of time.

The ferry service says customers are allowed to remain in their vehicles and there is enhanced cleaning and screening of travellers to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.

It says the resumption of service at Horseshoe Bay means service to Snug Cove and Langdale, as well as the ferry between Earls Cove and Saltery Bay, will be adjusted to reduce congestion and ensure passengers can make any connections.

BC Ferries announced the 60-day suspension of service between Horseshoe Bay and Departure Bay on April 3 in response to the pandemic.

The company says it will strictly adhere to health and safety guidelines from B.C. health officials as well as Transport Canada as it gradually resume its services."
Huffington Post,Trudeau To Push Provinces On Paid Sick Leave After Pressure From NDP,https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/trudeau-paid-sick-leave-ndp_ca_5ecbef9ec5b6c18b30fa6dd6,Possible Skew,,Fair interpretations of the news,,"OTTAWA — Jagmeet Singh says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s promise to work with provinces to give workers paid sick leave is a good start, but more action is needed before federal New Democrats will agree to suspend full sittings of the House of Commons through the summer.

The back and forth over paid sick leave Monday came as a small number of MPs debated a Liberal government motion proposing to waive “normal” Commons sittings in favour of expanding the special COVID-19 committee that has acted as a stand-in for the past month.

Because they hold only a minority of seats, the Liberals need the support of at least one of the main opposition parties to pass this motion. With the Conservatives demanding the resumption of Commons sittings and Bloc Quebecois not involved in negotiations, that leaves the NDP.

Shortly before debate started on the floor of the House of Commons, Singh, the leader of the federal NDP, laid out his conditions for supporting the Liberal motion by demanding real action on paid sick leave for all Canadians and support for people with disabilities struggling with the COVID-19 crisis.

During his daily news conference outside his home in Ottawa Monday, Trudeau said it makes sense to support paid leave for all workers if they’re ill, so people who might be infected with the novel coronavirus don’t have to choose between going to work sick and not getting paid.

“The government will continue discussions with the provinces without delay on ensuring that as we enter the recovery phase of the pandemic, every worker in Canada who needs it has access to 10 days of paid sick leave a year,” Trudeau said.

“We’ll also consider other mechanisms for the longer term to support workers with sick leave.”

Yet Singh said the promise fell short of the NDP’s demands.

“We’ve seen a positive announcement today by the prime minister, but it is not enough,” Singh told the House of Commons. “We need to see the action as well. And we are hopeful though that action will be coming.”

The NDP leader had previously suggested the federal government use the Canada Emergency Response Benefit or employment insurance to deliver paid sick leave immediately and work with the provinces to secure two weeks of leave even after the pandemic is over.

The government must also make good on a promise to provide more support to Canadians with disabilities who are struggling during the pandemic, Singh said."
Journal de Montreal,«Bonne nouvelle» pour la recherche d’un vaccin,https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2020/05/25/bonne-nouvelle-pour-la-recherche-dun-vaccin,Possible Skew,,Quality News,,"Les patients guéris de la COVID-19 développent une réponse immunitaire semblable à celle que veulent recréer de nombreux scientifiques en quête d’un vaccin, d’après des chercheurs américains qui y voient donc une «bonne nouvelle» pour le développement d’un vaccin. 

Après avoir analysé le sang de 20 adultes qui ont combattu avec succès la maladie, les chercheurs de l’institut californien en immunologie de La Jolla ont conclu que le système immunitaire du corps humain reconnaît bel et bien le coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, qui cause la COVID-19. 


Plus spécifiquement, ils ont trouvé des cellules immunitaires, les cellules T, qui contribuent aux défenses de l’organisme. 100 % des individus étaient porteurs de cellules appelées «CD4», qui aident à la production d’anticorps, tandis que 70 % avaient des cellules appelées CD8, qui éliminent les cellules infectées. 

réponse « robuste » 

En plus, cette réponse immunitaire semble dirigée vers les fameuses protéi-nes en forme de pointe que l’on trouve à la surface du nouveau coronavirus. Or, c’est précisément à cette partie du virus que veulent s’attaquer plusieurs laboratoires à la recherche d’un vaccin pour freiner la pandémie. L’étude ne donne cependant pas d’indication sur la force de cette immunité ou sa durée. 

«Si nous n’avions vu que des réponses immunitaires marginales, nous aurions été inquiets, mais ce que nous voyons est une réponse très robuste des lymphocytes T contre la protéine en pic, qui est la cible de la plupart des efforts en cours contre la COVID-19 [...]. Ces résultats sont vraiment de bonnes nouvelles pour le développement de vaccins», déclare le professeur Alessandro Sette, dans un article diffusé par cet institut de San Diego. 

Immunité croisée 

Fait intéressant, dans cette étude publiée il y a une dizaine de jours par la revue Cell, les chercheurs ont aussi analysé 20 autres échantillons recueillis de 2015 à 2018, soit bien avant le début de l’actuelle pandémie. Pourtant, entre 40 et 60 % de ces individus étaient porteurs de cellules immunitaires réagissant contre le SARS-CoV-2. 

Cela alimente l’hypothèse de «l’immunité croisée», qui fait débat à l’heure actuelle dans la communauté scientifique et médicale, voulant qu’une infection antérieure à d’autres coronavirus – qui causent, eux, des rhumes bénins – fournisse une protection contre la COVID-19 à certaines personnes. «Ce n’est pas clair encore» que cela est possible, relativisent cependant les auteurs californiens."
Maclean's,The incalculable rise of hydroxychloroquine,https://www.macleans.ca/society/health/the-incalculable-rise-of-hydroxychloroquine/,Possible Skew,,Fair interpretations of the news,,"In early April, Sonja Gill, rheumatologist based in Oakville, Ont., began to get shaky inquiries from some of the patients she treats who suffer from lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. They’d sought to fill routine prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that quiets the symptoms of these two auto-immune conditions, but their pharmacists were saying they had none.

“We’ve had call after call,’’ says Gill, who estimates that 70 per cent of her 1,500-patient practice are on hydroxychloroquine. She asked her administrative assistant to beat the bushes with pharmacies and wholesalers to find supplies. 

“If we don’t have it, [switching to another medication] is a tough decision,” Gill says. “The hard part has been telling patients what to do.”

There was little mystery as to the cause. For several weeks in early April, President Donald Trump and chorus of U.S. media were talking and posting ceaselessly about how hydroxychloroquine, a generic drug, could be the miracle cure for coronavirus, allegedly reducing the levels of the virus in infected patients and thus hastening recovery.  

“They’re not blind,” Gill says of her patients. “All this stuff has been on TV since Trump tweeted about it.” All of a sudden, the drug joined the inauspicious list of commodities—toilet paper, Lysol wipes, flour, yeast, face masks and more—experiencing pandemic-related shortages. The upshot: Gill’s patients had become unwitting victims of Trump’s war on science. 

The hydroxychloroquine saga, which quieted following reports of over-dose deaths but has lumbered back into view in recent days with Trump claiming he’s taking the drug to ward off COVID-19, offers a stark lesson in how science, social media, politics and global supply chains have collided unpredictably in this crisis. 

When reports with preliminary findings about treatments and vaccines go viral, they don’t just stoke public expectations. The publicity sets off chain reactions that reverberate messily through regulatory agencies, doctors’ offices, and even within drug companies that are, in some cases, forced to scramble to meet surging demand.     

What’s more, the hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus tale is by no means over. Some experts have strongly opposed the use of hydroxychloroquine, including Richard Bright, a doctor leading the U.S. federal Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, who was ousted by Trump for his outspokenness. On May 22, peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet published a study that looked at how 15,000 COVID-19 patients in almost 700 hospitals responded to various permutations of hydroxychloroquine and antibiotics. The key takeaway: patients exhibited a heightened risk of heart arrhythmia suggesting that these treatments “are not useful and could be harmful in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.” 

Despite the mounting evidence, a significant amount of clinical research into the drug’s safety and efficacy is now underway, via international randomized control trials whose investigators include doctors at teaching hospitals in Ontario, Nova Scotia, Manitoba and Alberta, and hundreds of Canadian COVID-19 patients are or will be participating. If these long-term studies support the use of hydroxychloroquine, the Canadian market could face a period of jarring upheavals and shortages.

Unlike the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Health Canada hasn’t permitted physicians to administer hydroxychloroquine, either alone or with antibiotics, to relieve COVID-19 symptoms. But medical interest in the drug was circulating before the president waded into the fray. Researchers like Kevin Kain, MD and a Canada Research Chair in infectious diseases at Toronto’s University Health Network, had for several years been aware of lab research demonstrating the anti-viral properties of one of the active ingredients in hydroxychloroquine. 

In early March, he joined an international team to set up a “double blind, placebo controlled” randomized clinical trial (the gold standard), to examine the potential of using the drug preventatively for frontline health care workers. “This was all way before Trump  poisoned the waters with misinformation and the release of one very poor quality ‘study’ from France,” Kain says. 

The French study, published online in the International Journal of Anti-microbial Agents  involved 42 patients and was later tweeted by Trump. Of those treated with the drug, the précis claims they showed a “significant reduction” in infection, although the comments at the end concede the results are “preliminary.” (The New York Times recently published a hard-hitting profile of the lead investigator, a charismatic microbiologist named Didier Raoult, questioning his earlier research.)

One doesn’t need to have a PhD to know that such small samples don’t produce definitive results. Medical ethicist Sunit Das, an associate professor at the University of Toronto’s Centre for Ethics, notes that the French paper says it is a case study using “level–three evidence,” a term all medical researchers understand. “This is not the sort of evidence that should drive clinical treatment,” says Das.  

Kain, however, goes much further, dismissing the French paper as “shoddy work that shouldn’t have been published.” (Das disagrees.) But the fact is that it was published online, on journal sites without paywalls, meaning these findings were available to anyone. Research from the Journal of the American Medical Association, which analyzes internet searches of hydroxychloroquine, shows that the release of the French study coincided with the steep slope that begins with a tweet by Elon Musk and crests in mid-March with Trump’s endorsement. 

Another pair of small-ish studies, one done in Brazil, the other in several veterans’ hospitals in the U.S., concludes the opposite: that hydroxychloroquine is either ineffective or unsafe. Kain says these findings—one based on 81 cases and the other on 368 patients—fuelled a backlash. They informed disparaging comments made by Richard Bright, the ousted U.S. official. (A larger study of 1,466 people admitted to ER with COVID-19 and published in early May in the New England Journal of Medicine was inconclusive.)

Some of these studies looked at high-dose treatments, and one wasn’t even peer-reviewed before it went online. Almost any drug, consumed in large amounts, can be toxic, Kain says. He also stresses that his goal as a scientist isn’t to prove that hydroxychloroquine is a miracle treatment, but rather to answer the question about its efficacy definitely and rigorously.

While Health Canada is allowing anyone being treated in a hospital for COVID-19 to participate one of the many clinical trials now underway, researchers in both Canada and the U.S. say it’s been difficult recruiting participants because of sensational media reports about people dying after ingesting high doses of hydroxychloroquine. While the drug does have heart, kidney and liver side effects, Kain points out that physicians have been using it safely for 70 years, so it’s not difficult for researchers to structure trials to ensure proper doses.

In late March, Mint Pharmaceuticals, a Mississauga, Ont.-based generic drug manufacturer that distributes about 60 per cent of all hydroxychloroquine used in Canada, received two very large orders from a wholesaler that provides pharmaceuticals to hospitals. The orders, equivalent to all the hydroxychloroquine used in Canada in 2019, set off alarm bells.

Just days before, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration made the contentious and subsequently criticized decision to allow physicians to use hydroxychloroquine, in conjunction with an antibiotic, to treat COVID-19. 

Federal officials in Ottawa began monitoring the situation and conferring with Canadian suppliers in weekly “stakeholder” calls. No one at the time understood why Canadian hospitals would be stockpiling, but the huge orders raised the prospect that “legacy” patients (those with lupus or rheumatoid arthritis) may not be able to fill prescriptions.

According to Mint CEO Jaiveer Singh, the fast-growing firm has been making and distributing hydroxychloroquine in Canada since 2014, generating about $7 million on the drug in 2019. Mint’s not the only generic firm distributing it in Canada, but the competition in recent years has narrowed. Some global players have abandoned the product in Canada because the going price—set by provincial drug formularies—has fallen, and is now well below what hydroxychloroquine costs in the U.S. 

By late March, Singh warned Health Canada officials that those large hospital orders could quickly soak up pharmacy supply normally used to fill prescriptions for patients with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. “We were really concerned,” Singh says. He urged the government to place a large emergency order to ensure there was enough to go around. “The federal government at that point,” he says, “took more of a cautious approach. They didn’t want to increase the stockpile.”

That’s when the supply chain issues began to loom large. Thanks to the pandemic, the costs of the active ingredient in the drug and shipping had all jumped while the Canadian dollar was plunging. Singh says he worries about continuing to supply the Canadian market if the company costs exceed the prices set by the provinces. 

Mint’s manufacturing partner for hydroxychloroquine is a large producer in India, which, as Singh says, has become the world’s pharmacy. As global demand for the drug surged (on the wave of Trump’s tweets), and the pandemic took hold in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government closed the border to pharmaceutical exports, disrupting international supply chains. 

After Ottawa had finally agreed to increase Canada’s emergency storehouse for legacy patients in mid-April, Singh, senior government officials and the Indian consulate in Toronto began hustling to secure a five-million-tablet shipment from Mint’s Indian supplier, to be exempted from the export ban on humanitarian grounds. The drugs arrived in Mint’s Mississauga warehouse in early May and are being stored in a cage monitored around the clock by closed-circuit cameras.

And what about those big hospital orders Mint had to fill? Some of those tablets will likely be used in the clinical trials now underway across Canada. But we won’t know the results until later in the year, at the earliest. If they prove this venerable malaria drug does treat COVID-19, Singh says Mint will ramp up production to serve the Canadian market. But the inevitable scramble will bring other difficult choices: who should get first crack at the drug: COVID-19 sufferers or the lupus and arthritis patients who would have to take stronger alternatives? 

Beyond the particulars of the hydroxychloroquine tale, this episode raises—or re-visits—broader ethical questions about the rapid dissemination of half-baked research to a hyper-connected world that can’t wait to rid itself of this virus. 

Stories about other premature findings—the latest being news reports that Moderna Inc., a publicly-traded $26 billion-a-year biotech giant, had encouraging results for eight healthy people injected with a trial vaccine—continue to find their way out of the normally staid scientific literature ecosystem and into the hurricane that is social media.

This dynamic has prompted concern to ripple through the highest echelons of the medical research establishment. “The pandemic will inevitably leave considerable morbidity, mortality, and loss in its wake,” the New England Journal of Medicine opined. “Damage to the country’s medication-assessment process—and the public’s respect for it—should not be part of its legacy.”

In the meantime, rheumatologist Sonja Gill is just hoping that her patients won’t have to face yet another round of unnerving shortages triggered by the viral spread of research results that have yet to be exposed to proper scientific scrutiny. "

CBC,Ontario won't specify COVID-19 'hotspots' even as premier urges testing,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/covid-hotspots-ontario-testing-1.5583679,Most Neutral,,Quality News,,"Premier Doug Ford is pleading with people who live in Ontario's COVID-19 ""hotspots"" to get tested for the virus — but officials won't specify which neighbourhoods have been hardest hit.

Ford mentioned the province's coronavirus hotspots multiple times during his daily news conference Monday. He said the government is able to measure them by postal code, and that some areas are ""lighting up like a Christmas tree.""

""We want to encourage people in the hotspots … please get tested,"" Ford said.

But that data has not been made public. CBC News has requested a breakdown of cases by postal code, but Hayley Chazan, spokesperson for the provincial minister of health, would only say that Ontario's hardest-hit regions are in Toronto, Peel Region and Windsor-Essex County.

Ford elaborated slightly Monday afternoon, saying ""parts"" of those regions were most affected. He also mentioned parts of Brampton, north Etobicoke and Scarborough.

According to the latest data from the province, Toronto-area public health units account for 64.8 per cent of Ontario's cases.


Premier Doug Ford says the testing will be narrowed to some postal codes that are 'lighting up like a Christmas tree' and need greater attention. 1:09
""We're going to get people out where the hotspots are and get them tested,"" Ford said, though he did not elaborate on exactly how that would happen.

Ford said the province plans to launch ""the next steps"" of its testing strategy in the coming days. The first steps of that plan began this weekend, he said, with testing of hospital workers — symptomatic or not — and inmates and staff in correctional facilities.

""I want as many people tested as possible,"" he said.

But that hasn't been happening. Ontario has routinely been missing its testing target in recent days, with just 8,170 tests processed since the province's last daily update. 

That's far below the benchmark of 16,000 per day and nowhere near the almost 20,000 tests Ontario has the capacity to handle on any given day. The backlog of tests waiting to be processed is sitting at 3,883.

Ford, who has repeatedly stated he wants to see more testing, said Monday the province's plan ""will take time to fully ramp up.""

Avoiding stigma
But the province might be reluctant to name the hotspots because of the stigma that could cause, says Dr. David Fisman, professor of epidemiology at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health.

""I think we know more than what is being discussed publicly about where the hotspots are, particularly within the [Toronto area],"" Fisman, who is also a physician at Michael Garron Hospital, said Monday on CBC Radio's Metro Morning.

""I think there are some very important discussions happening internally in public health agencies about stigma. Because this happens again and again with infectious diseases — where you draw a circle around a place that has higher rates of infection, and all of a sudden folks say 'that's where the infectious people are,'"" he said.

""I think there's a great desire not to create that kind of dialogue or that kind of rhetoric in Toronto.""

Fisman also said that health units in particularly affected areas need help to snuff out the virus. That would include support for people in dense areas who might have trouble physically distancing, protective equipment for front-line workers, and mobile testing for people who have difficulties getting to a testing centre.

""I don't think this is about enforcement or further stigmatization,"" he said.

""I think this is about supporting vulnerable parts of the GTA so that we can get this done."""

« Une reprise saine reconnaît que la santé humaine, celle de l’économie et celle de la planète sont intimement liées », a déclaré Jeni Miller, la directrice exécutive du Global Climate and Health Alliance, qui chapeaute cette initiative, en collaboration notamment avec l’Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS).

Ces 40 millions de médecins, infirmières et autres professionnels de la santé de 90 pays — et dont certains sont sur la ligne de front du combat contre le coronavirus — leur ont ainsi envoyé une lettre ce lundi qui détaille leurs espoirs.

Pour eux, cela signifie investir entre autres dans des énergies renouvelables, le transport en commun et la conservation de la nature, afin de réduire la pollution de l’air et les émissions qui réchauffent le climat, menaçant la santé des humains, plaident-ils.

Les communautés médicales et scientifiques devraient d’ailleurs être impliquées dans le développement des mesures de relance.

iPolitics,Updated federal poverty line delayed due to COVID-19,https://ipolitics.ca/2020/05/22/updated-federal-poverty-line-delayed-due-to-covid-19/,Most Neutral,,Quality News,,"Efforts to redraw Canada’s official poverty line have been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

While the review period for the poverty line was scheduled to end in June 2020, with the revised measure ready to be used shortly after, Statistics Canada says the pandemic has made it difficult to receive feedback from experts, stakeholders and officials from different levels of government.

Statistics Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) had been working since 2018 to update the poverty line, known as the market basket measure, in order to reflect essential costs using a 2018 base year.

“Statistics Canada and ESDC have made progress in this engagement. However, we recognize that the present pandemic might not have provided the best conditions for people to provide feedback on the Market Basket Measure review,” said agency spokesperson Peter Frayne.

“Accordingly, Statistics Canada and ESDC will be extending the review period by an additional two months to the end of August.”

The measure is based on five general categories of costs needed to maintain an adequate standard of living across 50 different regions in Canada.

As it stands, the base year for the measure remains 2008, meaning certain costs such as housing are now outdated. 

Since the Liberals formed government in late 2015, more than one million Canadians have risen above the poverty line. It includes both for the 2008 base year measure and a preliminary 2018 measure offered by Statistics Canada in February, when the 2018 Canadian Income Survey was released.

Frayne said following the review period, Statistics Canada will expedite publication of new poverty figures. 

He added the release of the new poverty line will “provide important contextual information on the situations of Canadians prior to the COVID pandemic.”

While a bump in the official poverty rate is expected once the new measure is used, the pandemic has hit Canadians working lower wage jobs particularly hard, meaning some of the real gains in reducing poverty under the Liberal government could be erased if economic recovery efforts exclude them."
Hill Times,"Focus on pandemic response, Trudeau tells MPs, as Parliamentarians discuss how to proceed during COVID-19 crisis",https://www.hilltimes.com/2020/05/25/focus-on-pandemic-response-trudeau-tells-mps-as-parliamentarians-discuss-how-to-proceed-during-covid-19-crisis/249765,Most Neutral,,Quality News,,"As the House returns to debate a motion on how to proceed amid the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a “need” for MPs to stay focused on responding to the fallout of the pandemic instead of other priorities, says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. 

“Work still continues throughout the government on important non-COVID priorities, but right now, in Parliament, the focus needs to be on the crisis that has taken over almost every aspect of Canadians’ lives and of our economy,” Mr. Trudeau (Papineau, Que.) said in his daily briefing to reporters on Monday.

“We will continue to work to address the needs that Canadians face, both through this health crisis, and into the economic challenges, as we begin to recover from this COVID-19 crisis,” he told reporters ahead of Parliament’s debate on the future of proceedings. “It’s important that we have Parliament and its institutions function well, and that’s what we are continuing to demonstrate.”

The House was suspended on March 13, but has been recalled on a few occasions to pass emergency legislation. An April motion that was backed by the Liberals and other opposition parties, except for the Conservatives—who pushed for more in-person meetings—saw the creation of a special COVID-19 committee that allowed MPs to meet virtually on Tuesdays and Thursdays. That motion also allowed one in-person sitting in the Chamber on Wednesdays, but the deal has expired. 

Mr. Trudeau’s Liberals pitched a motion last week that would allow the committee to meet for an extra day each week, on Mondays, and see a small number of MPs reconvene in the Chamber, along with some MPs from outside of Ottawa, who would join via videoconference, which itself would be streamed in the Chamber. The government has framed it as a proposal that respects public health advice on gatherings while still ensuring accountability and transparency.

The Conservatives said they will table their own motion that would declare Parliament an essential service, in an effort to call for all committees to begin meeting virtually. So far, eight committees have been given the green light to meet and discuss issues around the pandemic. The Liberals’ motion adds the Fisheries and Oceans Committee to that list, an addition that the NDP supports. Committees would also be allowed to discuss matters unrelated to the pandemic under the Liberals’ motion.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh (Burnaby South, B.C.) told reporters Monday that his party’s support for the government’s motion is dependent on a commitment to provide paid sick leave to those who contract COVID-19. Mr. Singh said a short-term fix would require a “slight modification” to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, a program that provides $2,000 up to four months for those who have been furloughed or forced to leave work to care for someone with the virus. Additionally, the NDP has asked the government to provide further support to those living with a disability.

“Without those two things, we will not support the government. With those two things, we’re prepared to support,” Mr. Singh said. “We proposed a way of going forward, and our proposal was to have a hybrid system, with MPs participating physically and virtually, and to sit four days throughout the summer in order to be able to hold the government to account to ask questions.”

In the long term, he said, he wants to see the government commit to working with the provinces to develop a paid-sick leave program. Mr. Singh said B.C. Premier John Horgan has already expressed a willingness to work with the feds.

Mr. Trudeau in his remarks cited “ongoing discussions” with jurisdictions about how to create such a program that will allow workers 10 days of sick paid leave. 

“We don’t want people to go back to work when they’re sick. In order to prevent that from happening, we’re prepared to work with the provinces to put in place a paid sick leave program,” he said. “As for the bill, we’ll have to work on that and determine that, but the purpose is very clear; we don’t want people to feel forced to go back into work if they have symptoms of COVID-19.”

His comments appear to be in direct response to the NDP’s push for 10 days of paid sick leave, in exchange for the opposition party’s support for its motion.

He also defended the Liberal Party’s application to the federal wage subsidy program, which covers 75 per cent of an employer’s wages for those who have seen a significant revenue dip. Organizations must show a 30 per cent drop in revenues compared to this time last year, and it is open to charities and nonprofits. The NDP, Greens, and the Conservatives have also applied for the benefit, according to CBC, while the Bloc Québécois has decided not to apply. 

“The reality is that there are workers in all types of industries, in all types of organizations right across the country, who depend on their job and their salary to help their family and pay for their groceries and rent,” said Mr. Trudeau. “We made the decision to ensure that that wage subsidy would be accessible to businesses and nonprofit organizations. That is a decision that will allow the economy to come back strong afterwards and I believe it was the right decision, because we must be able to support Canadians, in whatever organizations or company they work for.”

Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet (Beloeil—Chambly, Que.) on Monday criticized the move,  calling it “absolutely unacceptable.” 

“The money is not a gift provided to the people by the government, because they are nice people. It is reserved for businesses, the companies and the people who really need it,” he said, taking shots at the Liberals and Conservatives who he said “don’t need it.”

Mr. Trudeau refused to say if when the program and criteria were designed, it was done so in anticipation that political parties would be among those applying."

Globe and Mail,Canadian coronavirus vaccine candidate delivers promising results in animal tests,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-canadian-vaccine-candidate-delivers-promising-results-in-animal-tests/,Most Neutral,,Quality News,,"Because of physical distancing, Darryl Falzarano and his colleagues couldn’t celebrate with a group hug when they completed a successful test of their candidate vaccine for COVID-19.

Nor could they share their promising results with other colleagues at the University of Saskatchewan’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organizaton-International Vaccine Centre, since they are the only scientists allowed to come to work in the Saskatoon-based facility.

But it was exciting news nonetheless when their readouts showed that the ferrets in their study were able to fight off the disease after receiving two doses of the team’s in-house vaccine. The positive outcome sets the stage for tests with human subjects, which could begin as early as this fall.

“It’s what we were looking for, so that tells us to continue on the path that we’re on,” said Dr. Falzarano, who is the lead investigator on the project.

The Saskatoon team, which had previously been working toward a vaccine for MERS, a related disease caused by a different coronavirus, pivoted to working on COVID-19 as soon at the genetic sequence of the virus was published in February. Weeks later, their lab was the first in Canada to isolate the virus.

The team’s results, announced on Monday, are the latest hopeful sign that – so far – Canadian researchers and their global counterparts are making progress in their efforts to produce a vaccine that will be safe and effective against COVID-19.

Earlier this month, Quebec-based biotech company Medicago Inc. announced positive results of animal studies with its vaccine candidate. Last week, IMV Inc., another Quebec company, said it is in a similar position. Both companies have indicated that they hope to begin clinical trials this summer pending Health Canada approval.

Meanwhile, a clinical trial of the first and only COVID-19 vaccine that is already approved for human testing in Canada is set to begin next week and could grow to include as many as 600 participants by the end of August.

The vaccine was produced by CanSino Biologics, a Chinese company, using an approach that stems from an earlier collaboration with Canada’s National Research Council. It was first tested in a non-randomized clinical trial that involved 108 subjects in Wuhan. Last week, the effort yielded the first peer-reviewed study of any COVID-19 vaccine, published on Friday in the medical journal The Lancet. Researchers in China reported that their subjects experienced mostly mild to moderate reactions, and that the vaccine stimulated the production of antibodies that can neutralize the virus. More work will be needed to confirm the result. This will include the Canadian trial. But even larger trials will be needed to show if the vaccine is truly effective at preventing COVID-19. Even if all proceeds without a hitch, most experts do not expect a vaccine that is widely available for the public until next year.

Scientists caution that even at the breakneck speed with which the vaccine research is being conducted, it is still early days. Many candidate vaccines are likely to fail. Even those that succeed in animal studies and are shown to be safe for humans may produce lacklustre results once studies expand.

This why the global race to develop a vaccine is proceeding in multiple directions. As some candidates flame out, others will take over as front runners. And should more than one vaccine prove to be effective, it could turn out that different vaccines will work best for different subpopulations or age groups.

""There are a number of reasons to have multiple eggs in the basket,” said Scott Halperin, director of the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology in Halifax, which is organizing the trial of the CanSino vaccine. “The more candidates you have, the more likely you’re going to have a success.”

Several years ago, Dr. Halperin, who is also a professor at Dalhousie University, was involved in developing an adjuvant – a compound that primes the immune system and can improve a vaccine’s performance. The Saskatoon team is using the adjuvant in its vaccine.

After the candidate vaccine was developed in March, the team administered it to ferrets in two immunizations 28 days apart. After another 28 days, half the animals were exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19. The animals generated a strong immune response and produced antibodies that neutralized the virus.

“Based on our MERS data, we expected it to work in ferrets ... but you never know in science” Dr. Falzarano said. “We don’t have years of experience [with COVID-19], we have months.”

Medicago’s president and chief executive officer, Bruce Clark, said his company’s vaccine was tested in mice, which also generated antibodies. Further tests are needed to determine if those antibodies can neutralize the novel coronavirus. But Dr. Clark, who holds a PhD in biochemistry, said he was encouraged that the mice produced antibodies within 10 days after one shot of the vaccine. This suggests that if the vaccine is effective in humans, its immunizing effects will emerge quickly, he said.

“When you have as serious a disease as COVID, you don’t want something that’s going to take three months to generate the maximum response,” Dr. Clark added."

Huda Idrees, the founder and CEO of Dot Health, an app that collects and stores the user’s health information, said her company will also adopt permanent work-from-home measures once the contract for their downtown Toronto office expires at the end of the year.

“What we found is that we were quite productive working remotely,” she told CTV News.

There are plenty of obvious benefits to working from home, including a relaxed schedule and more time with family because there’s no longer a commute.

However, Zabeen Hirji, executive advisor for Future of Work, believes the offices aren’t going anywhere, even as more people shift home.

“I think there will be a need to bring people together physically and it could be that people work three days from home and two days from the office,” she said.

Hirji also served as the chief human resources officer at the Royal Bank of Canada for 10 years and said some employees were still hesitant to work from home as the company began offering more options to do so.

“RBC had flexible work arrangements and the option to work form home some of the time, but I was not comfortable taking advantage of it,” she said. “There was stigma attached to it.”

Hirji said the employees she’s talked to also have concerns with working from home, including less productivity, lengthy virtual meetings and missing a social interaction with colleagues.

“There are people that can’t work from home,” she said. “They can’t work from home because they don’t have the space (or) because they feel isolated.”

That said, a reduced reliance on office spaces could be a big problem for cities.

“When the rent starts to decline the leases stop renewing at the same rate then that valuation of properties may go down,” said Murtaza Haider, professor of real estate management at Ryerson University.

In Toronto, the municipal government collects more than $4.5 billion annually in property taxes, nearly half of which is from companies."
Global News,Overcrowded parks may cause coronavirus flare-ups but real risk lies indoors: experts,https://globalnews.ca/news/6980106/trinity-bellwoods-coronavirus-flare-ups/,Most Neutral,,Quality News,,"After images and videos surfaced of thousands flocking to Trinity Bellwoods Park in Toronto, there was public outrage and pleas from officials urging people to adhere to social distancing rules to avoid a more severe second wave of the coronavirus.

Possible outdoor transmission may not be a major driver of a second COVID-19 wave, but experts interviewed by Global News said it could make future outbreaks more extreme.
Dr. Alon Vaisman, an infection control and infectious diseases physician at Toronto’s University Health Network, said what happened at Trinity Bellwoods was troubling but transmissions are more likely to occur indoors, where a majority of outbreaks in Canada have been detected so far.
“In these public settings and the outdoors, the likelihood of transmission is low still. But if you multiply that out by numerous people, then you’re starting to increase the likelihood that something will happen,” he said.

How punishing the next wave of infection will be will most likely be the result of indoor habits, said Vaisman. But park overcrowding could bring the city back to a stage where much higher rates of transmission threaten to overwhelm the health-care system — what Vaisman dubs “the unsafe zone.”

“The second wave is inevitable. There’s no doubt about that. And third, fourth, those are all inevitable waves. There’s going to be waves and waves and waves into this. There’s nothing, there’s no way to permanently fix that until a vaccine comes around,” he said.
“There is a question of how severe it is… And that’s what large gatherings do, they make make the waves worse than they have to be.”
He noted that some of the responsibility falls on federal and provincial governments, who he criticized as having implied that the world will be able to return to a full normal after the pandemic.

“There are certain things are just simply never going to come back. A lot of things that we’ve done before — bars, restaurants, concerts, sporting events, they simply are never going to be safe for a long time,” Vaisman said.

“If you don’t let people know that, then they’re inevitably going to behave in such a way that’s dangerous because they’re just going back to the way things were.”

The City of Toronto spoke out in a statement against the “unacceptable” behaviour of those who crowded Trinity Bellwoods Park on Saturday, warning of a possible COVID-19 surge.
“Gatherings like this, where people aren’t keeping their distance from others, run the risk of setting Toronto back significantly in its efforts to stop the transmission of COVID-19,” the statement read.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, too, addressed the large crowds, reminding Canadians to wear masks when keeping two metres apart was not possible and to do their best to follow public health rules.

Dr. Susan J. Bondy, an associate professor at the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health, said it is unclear exactly how dangerous these actions are because the medical community is still learning about the risk of COVID-19 in specific environmental settings — “but there is really good reason to be concerned.”

Bondy said it was “disturbing” to see the size of the crowds at the Toronto park in a series of viral photos and videos online, especially given the high number of COVID-19 cases found in Ontario.

Images showed many people sitting closer than two metres apart. Many were exercising. Some were shouting and singing, all of which Bondy said have been associated with “clear outbreaks” in various parts of the world.
COVID-19 is transmitted from person-to-person, many of whom will be asymptomatic for several days before showing symptoms, she said.

“If somebody in that crowd was infectious but thought it was just seasonal allergies or if somebody was in that crowd and is about to get symptoms themselves in a couple of days, others will have been exposed.”

An “unknown, untold number” of local regional flare-ups and continued outbreaks, rather than waves — which imply a single pattern that could affect an entire province at once — will be expected until a vaccine is developed, Bondy said.
“This kind of event is exactly the kind of thing that leads to larger outbreaks,” she added. 

Infectious diseases specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch said flocking to parks was “counterproductive,” but hoped it would serve as an example of what not to do.
“This is clearly not how people should be behaving in the course of a pandemic,” he said.

“But if that one event was truly isolated to Trinity Bellwoods, as is hopefully the case, then hopefully this does not amount to a large explosion of cases and hopefully given the tremendous public outcry toward the scenes that were shared widely throughout the country, hopefully that’s enough to prevent scenes like that from happening again.”"
