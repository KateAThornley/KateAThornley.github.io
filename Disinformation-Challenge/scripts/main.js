			"The next federal election could shape up to be a battle over what the \u201cnew normal\u201d in Canadian society should look like after COVID-19.\n\nAccording to new polling from EKOS, a clear majority of Canadians agree that the pandemic has exposed \u201cugly truths\u201d about how workers and the elderly have been treated in Canada under the old status quo.\n\nThree-quarters (73%) of Canadians said they now expect a \u201cbroad transformation of our society\u201d as a result of the pandemic, with a majority saying they expect to see major social reforms that prioritize \u201chealth and well-being.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn searching for some positives in the short-term ruins of the pandemic, we are seeing some signs that this might be a segue to a better future which may not have been attainable without this tremendous shock to societies,\u201d EKOS notes.\n\n\nEkos\n\nIn all, 70% said the pandemic is creating the conditions for major reforms focused on the \u201chealth and well-being\u201d of ordinary Canadians, while 30% see a future that is \u201cmore authoritarian, stressing nationalism and security.\u201d\n\nCanadians are leaning towards that utopian vision of the future across all categories and partisan affiliations, with the exception of those who self-identify as supporters of the Conservative or People\u2019s Party, who are evenly split on the question.\n\n\nEkos\n\nCanadians agree the pandemic has exposed \u201cugly truths\u201d: The polling data also finds four-in-five Canadians agree the COVID-19 crisis has \u201crevealed\u201d problems in the treatment of elderly and disabled Canadians and social class inequality in Canadian society.\n\n\u201cA plurality believe it has revealed some ugly truths about the values we placed on the lives of the elderly and vulnerable. Many also believe that it has revealed some of the previously hidden injuries of social class,\u201d EKOS notes.\n\nThe poll also finds a \u201csizable majority\u201d think the crisis underlines the need to shift to a greener economy in the post-pandemic world.\n\n\nEkos\n\nStephen Harper disagrees: One person who can sense which way the winds of change are blowing is a former Canadian prime minister and current chairman of the Munich-based International Democratic Union.\n\nWriting in the Wall Street Journal, Stephen Harper warns global financial elites that the case for austerity may \u201cencounter serious resistance\u201d now that workers have seen what government can accomplish when the full power of the state is actually focused on the health and well-being of workers:\n\n\u201c\u2026 Opposition this time may even be stronger. Many workers have been reduced to limited stipends by government-ordered shutdowns \u2026 Those laid off in public institutions have generally received full pay. Their experience of a guaranteed maximum income will feed the delusion that current economic and fiscal management is somehow viable.\u201d",

			"There is a lot we still don't know about COVID-19 (coronavirus) and how hard it will impact Canada. But one thing we're learning: we are only as strong as our weakest link.\n\nCOVID-19 is exposing a number of weak links globally and here in Canada.\n\nFor starters, critical to containing COVID-19 are two new 2020 buzzwords -- social distancing and self-isolation. Health officials are asking people to do their part by staying home if they're sick and preparing to have two weeks' worth of medicine and provisions.\n\nWhile staying home is known to help curb the spread of COVID-19, it's hard advice to swallow if you're poor, working poor, in the service industry or self-employed.\n\nAs Hamilton Roundtable for Poverty Reduction director Tom Cooper points out in this Hamilton Spectator op-ed, the working poor can't afford to take unpaid time off and people on fixed (low) incomes -- such as people on social assistance -- don't have extra cash to stockpile provisions.\n\n\"If we truly want to keep our communities healthy and protect against the spread of illness, whether COVID-19 or anything else in the future, we need to pay more attention to the relationship between health and income inequality in Canada,\" Cooper writes.\n\nIt's not just the poor who face barriers. Precarious workers have challenges too.\n\nJon Shell, managing director and partner at Social Capital Partners, points out that self-employed workers will suffer from COVID-19.\n\n\"Spare a moment for the self-employed today as you focus on not touching your face,\" Shell tweeted. \"They can't avoid travel, need to go to client sites, and get no income if they self-quarantine. No corporate support and our social support system isn't designed to help them at all.\n\n\"We constantly push people to be 'entrepreneurial' and to 'hustle.' Let's remember that the lack of an appropriate and fair safety net for the self-employed is one of the many things this crisis is exposing. We need to fix it.\"\n\nIn this Toronto Star column, Jim Stanford, director of the Centre for Future Work, points to the need for legislated sick pay, better job security for workers who may need to follow the 14-day self-isolation COVID-19 protocol and better employment insurance provisions for workers who cannot work because of illness.\n\nLegislated sick pay is key: -research shows that cities and states in the United States that require employers to provide paid sick days have fewer flu cases.\n\nGetting rid of the need for doctors' sick notes is also key. Why flood doctors' offices with sick people when they should be at home resting and not spreading contagion?\n\nCOVID-19 could rock the global economy\nSpeaking of contagion, fears over COVID-19 and an oil sell-off led to panic in the stock markets Monday, forcing the New York and Toronto stock exchanges to briefly halt trading.\n\nIn the U.S., United Airlines and Jet Blue Airlines are cutting back flights due to a drop in demand due to COVID-19 fears.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada have cut interest rates in an attempt to protect the economy from a COVID-19/oil sell-off downturn.\n\nBusinesses are cancelling travel, conferences and meetings in response to the COVID-19 threat.\n\nIt's a reminder that the economy is only as strong as the health of our communities. And as Italy completely shuts down, COVID-19 is teaching us that we are only as strong as our weakest link in the global public health chain.\n\nThat's why investments in public health -- disease prevention, health promotion and protection -- are so critical.\n\nCuts to public health hurt\nIt's a lesson that seems to have gotten lost in Canada, all these many years after the SARS outbreak.\n\nAcross Canada, provincial governments have cut back on public-health spending. Just last year, the Ontario government made a move to slash public-health budgets and the Alberta government is in the process of implementing similar funding cuts. Other provinces have also seen dwindling public-health investments over the past decade.\n\nThe irony of public health is that it's undervalued until an invisible virus emerges, making the value of public health visible. After SARS, that visibility led to new investments in public health, but over time, funding has dwindled.\n\nThis Springer article says \"governments around the world underinvest in public health and public-health research.\"\n\nIn the OECD, health spending for prevention is rarely higher than six per cent of the health care budget. In Canada, only 5.5 per cent of total health spending goes to public health, such as food and drug safety, health inspection and health promotion.\n\nTrevor Hancock, retired public health professor at the University of Victoria, calls the underinvestment in public health short-term thinking.\n\n\"There are several factors at play, one of which may be that public health does not generate headlines, whereas dramatic life-saving interventions do,\" Hancock writes.\n\n\"When public health is effective, nothing happens; nobody writes headlines about the hundreds of cancers that did not happen, only about the latest hi-tech drug or intervention that reduced the death rate from cancer.\"\n\nThe advent of COVID-19 is helping us see public health in a new light.\n\nWhen it comes to trying to contain COVID-19 spread, we have strengths. Canada's public-health professionals took many lasting lessons from the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak and they are better prepared for COVID-19 than some countries.\n\nProtocols were in place to quickly identify potential COVID-19 patients and the source of infection, test them, treat them in hospital if needed and, otherwise, ensure they\u2019re self-isolating for 14 days. Even jurisdictions in the U.S. are struggling to meet these basics.\n\nCommunications from public-health officials in Canada have been steady, transparent, and reliable. In times of uncertainty, trust is key.\n\nIn order to maintain trust, Canada's public-health system needs to be better funded over the long haul. In the short term, expect pressure on the federal and provincial governments to respond to the dual crisis of COVID-19 and oil sell-off with major stimulus initiatives.\n\nEconomists are already talking about the need to \"supersize\" refundable tax credits like the GST or the Canada Child Benefit, to get cash in the hands of those who need it. But this is also a moment to correct the chronic underfunding of public-health units across Canada.\n\nIf we manage to contain COVID-19, it will be because of individual efforts to follow public-health protocols and because of the expertise of public-health officials in quickly establishing those protocols.\n\nThese are our strongest links in the system. Let's invest in keeping them strong.",

			"In 2005, Tom Lancaster and his wife bought a 510-square-foot, one-bedroom townhouse in East Vancouver.\n\n\nANNOUNCEMENTS, EVENTS & MORE FROM TYEE AND SELECT PARTNERS\nHang with Dorothy Woodend Wednesday. She Has Three Things to ShareHang With Dorothy Woodend Wednesday. She Has Three Things To Share \nIt\u2019s the latest in our series of Zoom get-togethers with Tyee folks.\n\nThree years later they were starting to plan to have kids and wanted to move to a bigger place. At the same time, the bubbly Vancouver housing market was starting to turn down in the wake of a housing market meltdown in the United States.\n\nSo Lancaster and his wife sold, feeling fortunate to have come out ahead, and brought their first child home to a rented basement suite while they tried to figure out their next move.\n\nTwo years and two evictions later their family had grown to four with the birth of their son, and the Lancasters had had enough of Vancouver\u2019s rental market. They decided to try to become homeowners again.\n\n\u201cWe scraped together the cash that we had and put a down payment on a house,\u201d said Lancaster, who works as a community planner.\n\nThe Tyee is supported by readers like you\n Join us and grow independent media in Canada\n\u201cAnd it was the biggest money pit.\u201d\n\nThe house in East Vancouver wasn\u2019t fancy or big, but it was gobbling up all the money Lancaster and his wife had.\n\n\u201cIt was the cheapest of all single-family houses on the market at the time,\u201d Lancaster said. \u201cIt was a tear down.\u201d\n\nWith his wife, a teacher, staying home to look after their two young children for two years, the couple found themselves scraping by on one income and struggling to make the mortgage payments. They decided to sell the house and buy something cheaper, like a townhouse or a condo.\n\nBut by then it was 2016 and prices were skyrocketing. Lancaster and his wife accepted an offer and sold the money pit. But while they waited for the actual closing date, prices jumped by around 30 per cent in their East Vancouver neighbourhood.\n\nThey were never able to buy again. Today they rent a house near Fraser Street in East Vancouver.\n\nFalling off the housing ladder\n\nOnce a young Canadian couple gets a foothold on the housing ladder \u2014 a small \u201cstarter\u201d house or condo \u2014 they\u2019re supposed to be able to steadily climb upwards, moving to bigger digs as their family grows, and steadily adding to a home equity nest egg that will pay off once they get to retirement age.\n\nBut in Vancouver some people have fallen right off the ladder, while many others can\u2019t figure out how to get on it in the first place. Housing prices have risen so far beyond average incomes that it takes a big extra boost \u2014 a financial gift from family, often using a parent\u2019s or grandparent\u2019s Vancouver-area home equity \u2014 to get on the first rung of the ladder.\n\n\u201cBack in the 1970s... it took the typical young person five years of full-time work to save a 20-per-cent down payment on the average-priced home,\u201d said Paul Kershaw, a professor at the University of British Columbia\u2019s School of Population and Public Health.\n\nToday it takes the average Canadian 13 years to save enough, said Kershaw, who is also the founder of Generation Squeeze, a lobby group for younger generations of Canadians.\n\nIn Ontario, that number rises to 15 years, and for B.C., it\u2019s 19 years. If you\u2019re trying to buy into the Greater Toronto Area, it would take you 21 years to save enough money. But Metro Vancouver tops them all: it now takes 29 years of full-time work to save a 20-per-cent down payment.\n\n851px version of VanHomePricesGraph.jpg\nVancouver housing prices soared after 2000, making owning a home an impossible dream for most first-time buyers.\nA country \u2018drunk on housing\u2019\n\nUniversity of Toronto professor David Hulchanski has tracked how Canadian government housing programs since the end of the Second World War have focused on boosting homeownership.\n\nThe federal and provincial governments created mortgage lending and insurance institutions, while municipal governments provided land and zoning to build \u201crelatively cheap housing in postwar subdivisions,\u201d Hulchanski wrote in a 2007 paper.\n\n\u201cSince the early 1970s, a steady stream of house purchase assistance programs has helped maintain Canada\u2019s ownership rate at about two-thirds.\u201d\n\nThe federal government created the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. in 1946, and the new agency \u201cfocused public funds almost exclusively on the ownership sector,\u201d according to Hulchanski.\n\nThe federal government did step up efforts to provide subsidized rental housing for low-income Canadians in the early 1960s, building 200,000 units of public housing between 1963 and the mid-1970s with provincial and community partners.\n\nAround the same time, federal tax breaks also fuelled a rental housing boom in Canadian cities.\n\nBut the social housing building boom came to an end in the early 1990s, when the federal government decided to get out of housing altogether \u2014 except when it came to homeownership.\n\nThroughout the 1990s and 2000s CMHC focused primarily on insuring mortgages, and many federal and provincial budgets contained tax exemptions, credits or other benefits for homeowners, especially first-time buyers. One of the biggest giveaways to homeowners, an exemption on paying capital gains tax on the sale of a principal residence, has been in place since 1972.\n\nBy the mid-2000s, Hulchanski notes, CMHC was helping homeowners at a vastly higher rate than it aided poor people who were having trouble paying their rent. For instance, he says, CMHC reported it had provided mortgage insurance to 746,157 homeowners in 2005 alone, compared to the 633,300 social housing units it had funded in the past 35 years.\n\nCanada was not alone in its focus on encouraging and subsidizing homeownership \u2014 many countries, including the United States, crafted policies designed to help people become homeowners. But in the wake of the 2008 U.S. financial crisis, which was triggered by a massive boom and bust in housing prices, experts and policy makers started to question the assumption that homeownership should always be the goal.\n\nToday the head of CMHC, Evan Siddall, is relaying a much different message. Build more purpose-built rental \u2014 a lot of it. And stop peddling the idea that homeownership is \u201cthe only path to financial security.\u201d He\u2019s warned that in \u201csupply constrained markets\u201d like Vancouver and Toronto, measures to help people become homeowners only increase the price of housing.\n\n\u201cWell-intentioned support for home buyers often proves to have the opposite effect by making affordability worse, merely adding to existing homeowners\u2019 wealth at the expense of younger Canadians,\u201d he wrote in the agency\u2019s 2018 annual report.\n\nIn remarks at a Feb. 13 event in Vancouver, Siddall summed up the city\u2019s place in Canada\u2019s housing continuum: \u201cIn a country that\u2019s drunk on housing,\u201d he said, \u201cVancouver is our No. 1 distillery.\u201d\n\nBut the COVID-19 crisis has shown how CMHC is still set up to help homeowners quickly, but not renters. In response to the economic fallout, CMHC quickly announced it would support mortgage deferrals on March 13.\n\nSiddall acknowledged the agency isn\u2019t set up to provide the same immediate help to renters: \u201cWe actually don\u2019t have an easy way to get support to renters quickly,\u201d he wrote to The Tyee in March.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s been provincial governments that have acted to support renters, with eviction bans or extra financial support.\n\nThe best laid plans\n\nVancouver\u2019s housing market dipped slightly in response to the 2008 financial crisis \u2014 but the last 20 years have been a period of enormous gains for existing homeowners.\n\n851px version of AffordabilityIndexGraph.jpg\nSoaring Vancouver real estate prices left first-time buyers on the sidelines.\nFor residents trying to enter the market for the first time, or get back in, it was a different story.\n\nThose who saved carefully for years could have their plans thrown awry by skyrocketing prices \u2014 or by unexpected events, like the addition of a new family member.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to Stefania Seccia and her husband, who cobbled together a down payment to buy a pre-sale condo in New Westminster in 2016. They used their savings and money that friends and family gave as wedding presents, and had just enough to pay a deposit and set aside a down payment for a $375,900 one-bedroom apartment in a project near Sapperton SkyTrain station.\n\nThe one-bedroom was all they could afford, and because Seccia and her husband had difficulty conceiving, they didn\u2019t expect to have children any time soon. But that changed in 2018, when their son Max was born \u2014 a surprise, but a very welcome one.\n\nNow the condo is almost complete and Seccia and her husband are trying to decide what to do. They currently live in a two-bedroom apartment in a housing co-op in Burnaby, and don\u2019t really want to downsize to a one-bedroom with a toddler, a dog and a cat \u2014 especially now, with both parents working from home and taking care of Max because of COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nBut they also can\u2019t sell and attempt to buy a bigger place right away, because they would have to pay capital gains tax on the sale of the brand-new condo. And while their one-bedroom condo has gone up in value, so have bigger units.\n\nSeccia said she\u2019s been advised she can move into the condo for six months and then sell in order to qualify for the capital gains tax exemption.\n\nFinancial uncertainties wrought by COVID-19 have also crept in. Seccia and her husband were recently approved for their mortgage, but they had to assure their bank that their jobs were \u201cCOVID-proof.\u201d The approval is only in place until July, so they\u2019re hoping the building will be complete before then.\n\nThe mortgage approval came as a huge relief, because if they hadn\u2019t qualified they feared losing their pre-sale deposit.\n\nBut even with all the moving parts and hard decisions, owning their own home still seems like the only way to really ensure stability for the future.\n\n\u201cAnything can happen \u2014 a few years ago there was a problem with the federal government, whether or not they\u2019d renew the [co-op\u2019s] mortgage,\u201d Seccia said.\n\n\u201cWe just see homeownership as a way to secure our future. I kind of hate that that dream seems so unrealistic.\u201d\n\nThe future of real estate\n\nStarting in 2016, the federal and B.C. governments introduced new taxes and other measures to slow down real estate speculation and rapid price increases. Vancouver\u2019s white-hot real estate market rapidly cooled in response. The slowdown was particularly significant for the highest-priced real estate in the market: the luxury condos of Yaletown and the West End, and single family homes in West Vancouver and Vancouver\u2019s west side.\n\nBut in the first few months of 2020 it looked like real estate was again on the upswing, especially for the lower-priced part of the market.\n\nNow with COVID-19 affecting every part of the global economy, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess. In March the BC Real Estate Association predicted home sales and prices would decline in the spring and early summer, \u201cbut should recover along with the wider economy in the second half of the year, contingent on the outbreak resolving.\u201d\n\nOthers suspect the economic impact will be wider and long-lasting. Three million jobs were lost in March and April, Canada\u2019s borders are still closed to non-essential travel and many prospective homebuyers are no longer able to get a mortgage because they\u2019ve been laid off or work in a vulnerable industry.\n\nSteve Saretsky, a realtor in Vancouver, said one of his clients was ready to put in an offer on a townhouse in late March. But when Saretsky followed up the next day, the buyer said he\u2019d been laid off.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people initially thought their job was safe,\u201d Saretsky said.\n\nSaretsky had a warning for the many Metro Vancouver residents who have been waiting for prices to fall so they can finally get into the market \u2014 not so fast. New condos are still being completed and unsold inventory is building, which should push prices down.\n\nBut he questioned how many buyers will qualify for a mortgage in the coming months.\n\n\u201cI just get the sense that everyone\u2019s thinking, \u2018I\u2019m going to buy the dip, like this is my opportunity,\u2019\u201d Saretsky said. \u201cPrices take a while to come down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just think people aren\u2019t quantifying the economic destruction.\u201d\n\nBased on previous policy decisions, Saretsky expects senior levels of government will intervene to prevent housing prices from falling too far.\n\nThere are several policy tools the federal government could use, Saretsky said, like allowing longer mortgage amortizations or easing a mortgage stress test put in place in 2018 to make sure homeowners could weather adverse financial conditions.\n\nWith prices in Vancouver staying stubbornly high, can first-time buyers expect to be able to get into the market?\n\nShelly Smee, a realtor with Oakwyn Realty in Vancouver, said it\u2019s still possible, but challenging. First-time buyers probably need to be on a high-earning career track and to have been saving for a down payment since their 20s, she said.\n\nMost are also getting significant financial help from parents or grandparents, who are using their own home equity to help their kids.\n\nSmee said around 70 per cent of the first-time buyers she works with today are in their late 30s.\n\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t have a plan for your life in your early 20s, and you didn\u2019t have the education or you didn\u2019t get on a career path to earn some money, then yeah, it becomes very difficult in your 30s and 40s to realize that the market\u2019s just kept going up,\u201d Smee said.\n\nBenjamin Tal, an economist at CIBC, said the Vancouver market went through \u201ca very healthy correction\u201d in 2018 and 2019.\n\nBut Tal doesn\u2019t believe the city will ever again have affordable real estate prices. Instead, he says, residents who want to stay will have to come to terms with being life-long renters.\n\n\u201cI think that homeownership in Canada and in Vancouver in particular probably has reached its peak,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think people will be able to afford buying houses to the extent that they used to, and therefore you will see a situation where more people look for other opportunities.\n\n\u201cAnd you will see families renting, and that\u2019s actually the future of real estate.\u201d\n\n851px version of LancasterFamilyTable.jpg\nTom Lancaster with son Odin and daughter Eliza. Lancaster and his wife were homeowners. But when they sold and tried to find a bigger place, soaring prices left them on the sidelines. Photo by Jen St. Denis.\nRenting forever is hard to accept\n\nTo Seccia and Lancaster, that\u2019s a hard pill to swallow. Both make solidly middle-class incomes. Seccia and her husband have lived frugally in the suburbs for years, putting up with a punishing daily commute.\n\n\u201cWe keep getting told, if you climb the ladder, if you keep making more money, your situation will get better,\u201d she said.\n\nLancaster said he sometimes feels like he\u2019s failing to provide properly for his children. When he looks around his Kensington-Cedar Cottage neighbourhood, he sees multiple houses owned by one person \u2014 or houses owned by people who got hundreds of thousands of dollars in financial help from their parents \u2014 and it just doesn\u2019t seem fair.\n\n\u201cAll these other [families] are going to leave a multimillion home to their kids later on, and we\u2019re going to leave our kids \u2014 hopefully \u2014 a place to rent,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the economists\u2019 mantra that building more housing will push prices down \u2014 or prevent them from rising further \u2014 Seccia believes that \u201chigh density developments are what\u2019s causing prices to go up.\u201d\n\nimage atom\nFixing a Family Housing Crisis\nREAD MORE \nDensity has been steadily increasing, she said, with no impact on prices.\n\nLancaster supports measures aimed at reducing speculation, like Vancouver\u2019s empty homes tax. But he\u2019d also like to see more housing built everywhere \u2014 including in traditionally single-family home neighbourhoods.\n\n\u201cWe need to build lots of rentals and lots of stuff to buy,\u201d he said. \u201cMy neighbourhood is undergoing dramatic change and I love it.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d also like to see the gap between homeowners and renters narrowed.\n\n\u201cI feel that housing is a human right and we live in cities where people are getting incredibly rich off of holding land and holding housing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe disparity between the people who own and those who rent is just so stark to us right now, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d",

			"In a new, blisteringly white-hot take called \u201cCoronavirus can trigger a new industrial revolution,\u201d a very super smart guy who knows better than us named Ed Conway explains how the coronavirus has an upside: \u201cUnlike most other such diseases, it kills mostly the old who, let\u2019s face it, are more likely to be climate sceptics. It spares the young. Most of all, it stymies the forces that have been generating greenhouse gases for decades.\u201d\n\nThis is a shocking display of hubris, looking intense, life-ending natural disaster in the face, and saying \u201chey, maybe it\u2019s not so bad.\u201d To a certain extent, we\u2019ve been waiting for this to happen. It was inevitable. After years of alarmism and dangerous fetishization, we\u2019ve reached the moment in our current age of hysteria and panic where a major publication is publishing an ode to a potentially cataclysmic pathogen because the side effects will be a lowering of carbon emissions and the death of the type of people who don\u2019t consider that a priority.\n\nQuarantines due to the viral outbreak have put the breaks on manufacturing in Wuhan, China, the locus of the outbreak. Images released by NASA show a sharp decline in nitrogen dioxide levels as millions of people have gone into quarantine and assembly lines have ground to a halt. People aren\u2019t working or engaging in life outside their homes. The result is a decline in pollution levels.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand that spells enormous disruption and could make all our lives more expensive,\u201d Conway writes of the coronavirus. \u201cYet there is also a silver lining which need not only appeal to Extinction Rebellion. What if this is the nudge we need to embrace a new model of globalisation?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that a sharp decrease in manufacturing drops emissions. When human beings stop being their naturally industrious productive selves, the earth and its other forms of life fill in the gaps. Extinction Rebellion, Greta Thunberg, and extreme climate activists are fond of letting us know just how terrible human beings are.\n\nBut is this really what we want? Wuhan has been a major player in Chinese manufacturing but is now barely recognizable.\n\n\nThe decline in manufacturing and disruption of supply chains gives progressive climate change extremists something of a proof of concept. Conway\u2019s idea for what life will look like after the virus has had its way for us is even more depressing that high pollution levels.\n\n\u201cFor the dirty secret about today\u2019s economy is that it is actually a product of yesterday\u2019s technologies: the foundation of just-in-time supply chains is software and internet connectivity. The ultimate energy source is fossil fuels, in ships and planes. Today\u2019s new technologies \u2014 3D printing, AI, robotics \u2014 could enable a very different form of globalization. Combine them and it is possible, as the economist Richard Baldwin says, to imagine hotel rooms in London being cleaned by robots controlled by cleaners in Poland, or lawns in Texas mowed by robots steered by gardeners in Mexico.\u201d\n\nWhat is being proposed here is that people become more isolated physically, more interconnected technologically, and further removed from each other and the world outside their locality than before. If we spent the 20th century getting together and learning each other\u2019s customs in person, feeling the air and ground of new places, the idea now is that we spend the 21st century stuck behind a fence of fear in our own backyards.\n\nIt is true that the COVID 19 virus is most likely to kill the elderly and the sick. But to take that fact and flip it as a positive because those lives somehow mean less than others is depraved and disgusting.\n\n\u201cThe chimneys which once belched smog into the skies of Beijing and Shenzhen are smoking no more \u2026 The coronavirus is one of those shocks that could force business to take the leaps they were hitherto too nervous to make.\u201d Conway croons as he casually suggests that this outcome may be worth losing a large percentage of our most vulnerable loved ones.\n\nThe old and the sick are human beings. But in his article, Conway is suggesting it\u2019s somehow worth losing them because they are more likely to be guilty of wrongthink. It\u2019s as though he\u2019s advocating for a kind of ideological eugenics based on the sick, woke views that he and his elite colleagues constantly try to enforce. If the non-conforming boomers can\u2019t be made to see reason, is the idea, perhaps we\u2019ll just get lucky and they\u2019ll die off sooner than life expectancy would indicate.\n\nExtreme activists would have us believe that the preservation of the world and the reversal of climate change is more important than anything else, from personal international travel to global trade, but when the effects are seen in action like this, it\u2019s hard to argue that people matter less than the planet.\n\nSaving the earth at the cost of the population is not a good goal, and those activists that decry humanity in the name of saving the world need to realize that human life and human progress are not negotiable. Humanity needs to innovate in service to the needs of human beings, not for some glorified fantasy of human isolation.\n\nWhile the climate crisis needs to be dealt with, it isn\u2019t through ramping down human activity that we will be successful, but in trusting human ingenuity and strength to figure out new energy sources that can provide greater power at less cost to humanity and the planet.\n\nPeople matter. All people. The young, old, sick, healthy, woke and redpilled. The practically pathogenic dehumanization that Conway is practising must be rejected at all costs.",

T.K. was being held at the time on drug trafficking charges. \n\nIn the decision, the judge cited a report that revealed the inmates were susceptible to the coronavirus due to the cramped and confined prison environment.\n\n\n19-year-old Kaynadid Abshir, who allegedly participated in a Toronto driveby shooting as a getaway driver, was also released from custody. \n\nAbshir was set to face several charges including attempted murder, aggravated assault, and numerous firearms offences. The judge cited Abshir\u2019s \u201ccircumstantial\u201d case, mental health issues, and clean record as the reasons behind his release.  \n\nIn another decision, alleged \u201cdrug supplier\u201d Brandon Cain was released from the Ottawa Carleton Detention Centre despite facing \u201cserious charges from a violent attack.\u201d \n\nCain and others were alleged to have assaulted victims with a pistol and taser, and also \u201cforcing the complainants to shoplift in order to pay off the drug debt for the stolen drugs,\u201d according to a ruling by the Superior Court. \n\nCain was released on $11,000 in bonds and house arrest, even though he violated the conditions of his prior bail release which forced police to take him back into custody. \n\nAnother man identified as T.L. in court documents was released after requesting to live with his grandparents. \n\nT.L. was alleged to have been involved in a Sept. 30, 2019 shooting that resulted in injuries.

			"Last week, Air Canada announced it was cutting its workforce by at least half, effective next month. This is not surprising, since flight attendants can\u2019t do their jobs when there are no flights. Air Canada is now flying at one-twentieth its pre-pandemic capacity. The airline hopes to ramp up operations in coming months, but even optimistic estimates put late-2020 airline travel volume at about one-quarter of baseline levels.\n\nSimilar patterns are playing out everywhere. COVID-19 has decimated the travel industry. It will return, of course, but will it be the same as we remember it?\n\nMy pre-boomer peers are almost all retirees, many securely well-heeled, and mad for travel. In their salad days, they planned trips hither and yon by themselves or with friends. The food tour through Italy, or the wine tour through France. Bicycles and hiking often were involved, along with local guides who would provide a deep dive into regional culture and history. No wasting away at Del Boca Vista for this set. Even the least ambitious will sign on to group trips, with age-appropriate itineraries and accommodations managed by experts. Cruises are much favoured. In 2019, an estimated 30 million passengers per year traveled the high seas.\n\nMy husband and I are neither of us tinctured with the wanderlust that afflicts so many of our friends. And yet, a little embarrassed at having seen so little of the world, we took to cruising many years ago as a compromise between our comfortable beaten path (Quebec cottage country, New England, Florida) and the more serious itinerary-driven travel that our peers gush about on Facebook.\n\nAmongst the pleasures provided by these floating palaces, apart from the bliss of unpacking only once for the duration, is the relaxing assumption that one is safe from the kind of unpleasant surprises real travelers stoically surmount on their roads less travelled\u2014a scorpion at one\u2019s toes in the scenic wilds of Costa Rica slipper, say, or the poisonous barb of some hideous thing lurking under the waves at a remote coastal beach. Plus, of course, the enchantment of awakening each day to a new, exotic port of call.\n\nOn a Black Sea cruise, I lighted on Varna, Yalta, and Odessa. A few hours in each, including a close inspection of the very hall in the czar\u2019s summer palace where the Allied leaders met in 1945, and I was back on the boat, satisfied that I\u2019d gotten a general sense of the place and its importance. The curators at Livadia Palace had even decked out the meeting hall in a way that corresponded to famous photos of the Yalta Conference. No, I didn\u2019t learn much more information about any of these places than might be contained in the small-print caption information on a postcard. But getting the overall historical gist of the place is fine for me, as it is for most of the cruising demographic. I am sure Istanbul would occupy any serious traveler for at least a week. But for voyaging wastrels like us, a few palaces, the Blue Mosque and the Grand Bazaar, with vendors clutching at one\u2019s arm and attempting to drag one into their leather-goods shops, were quite enough.\n\nBut now the words \u201ccruise ship\u201d conjure up the Diamond Princess, on which about a fifth of the ship\u2019s 3,711 passengers and crew became infected with COVID-19 in January. At least nine died. Several other cruise ships became COVID-19 hot-spots as well, demonstrating the ease with which the virus could spread in a confined space\u2014especially a confined space whose very purpose is to facilitate collective meals, recreation, gambling, drinking, and assorted merrymaking. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the average age of the Diamond Princess passengers was 69, certainly old enough to be in a high-risk category for COVID-19. Even in February, before lockdown measures in most countries began in earnest, my traveling friends were rightly terrified by news that this massive ship had become one giant floating quarantine station.\n\nOne must never underestimate the public\u2019s penchant for amnesia. The 1977 Norwalk gastroenteritis outbreak, which affected more than 500 passengers on multiple cruises, put a temporary damper on cruising for a while. But it picked up again, despite the fact that the virus still recurs from time to time. (As recently as 2019, a Royal Caribbean cruise was cut short when hundreds were sickened.) Noroviruses aren\u2019t typically fatal, though I guarantee that anyone who gets Norwalk won\u2019t forget the experience soon.\n\nBut this amnesia has its limits. And so I offer my prediction that\u2014absent a foolproof vaccine, of the type we have for measles\u2014COVID-19 will deal the big ships a knockout blow. Even once the lockdown policies end, oldies will continue voluntarily to observe far stricter semi-isolation rules than everyone else. It\u2019s simply a matter of cost-benefit analysis. Yes, the pleasurable benefits we enjoy on the lido deck are somewhat greater than those that would be experienced by the average millennial hipster (though he might still derive some fleeting pleasure in a purely ironic capacity). But the statistically calculated costs would be much higher, since there is a good chance that COVID-19 would be fatal for me, but likely present as little more than a mild flu for someone half my age.\n\nAs with many of the changes that COVID-19 will bring about\u2014including the retail migration to Amazon and the trend of people working from home\u2014this may be a case of simply accelerating something that would have come about anyway. Every new generation is more sensitive to environmental issues than the one before. And cruise ships gobble obscene amounts of fuel, and can directly or indirectly befoul some of the most beautiful places on Earth. They also happen to be floating dens of all-you-can-eat gluttony that sometimes resemble a fattening farm run by Kang and Kodos. Even before COVID-19, cruising already was seen as a politically incorrect, white-privilege, \u201cOk, boomer\u201d form of indulgence. We live in an age when even many grandparents follow social media and know the derisive cruise memes from Seinfeld et cetera. They were willing to suffer the stigma associated with cruising for the sake of the attendant pleasures. But add on the threat of respiratory failure and you can bet they\u2019ll opt instead for a socially isolated bike tour with Butterfield & Robinson.\n\nThe demise of big-ship cruising should not be regretted, even if my own memories are fond. And the ships themselves could be repurposed in permanent dockage as time-share condos. Fort Lauderdale in our winter one year, Sydney in Australia\u2019s summer the next. True, you\u2019ll never be able to step off in Yalta to gaze upon the room where Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt planned the architecture of the post-war world. But at the end of the day, a room is just a room, just as a beach is just a beach. As Wikipedia attests, Allied leaders had the foresight to snap their own selfies back in 1945. In the post-COVID-19 world, I\u2019m really not sure how many of us will be risking infection to snap our own.",

			"Metis villages in northern Saskatchewan with rising COVID-19 cases are in \u201cjurisdictional limbo\u201d between federal and provincial governments that left them underprepared for the coronavirus pandemic, according to Metis National Council (MNC) spokesperson David Chartrand.\n\n\u201cThere was no plan, no supports, no programs, no supply chain, nothing, because both governments are saying, \u2018No, it\u2019s not my jurisdiction. It\u2019s yours.\u2019,\u201d Chartrand told the Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs (INAN), which met virtually to discuss the pandemic\u2019s impact on Indigenous communities.\n\n\u201cBoth are still blaming each other, and [COVID-19\u2019s] still creeping into the next villages now because families are taking it to the next villages not realizing they\u2019re carrying it.\u201d\n\nFirst Nations Inuit Health Branch (FNIHB) which is under Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) provides on-reserve health-care services for First Nations as well as Inuit in the territories but throughout the pandemic has said Metis communities are under provincial jurisdiction.\n\nBut Chartrand says the province passes responsibility back to Ottawa.\n\n\u201cAt the provincial level, despite our staggering chronic illnesses, the province tells us to deal with the federal government to deal [with] our unique health-care conditions and needs. Our pandemic plans have been limited to providing income and food supports,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the Incident Command Centre (ICC) in northwestern Saskatchewan, 146 people had tested positive for the novel coronavirus in the municipalities of Beauval, La Loche, Buffalo Narrows, Ile-a-la-Crosse and Jans Bay as of May 7.\n\n\u201cThose are all Metis villages,\u201d Chartrand said.\n\nAccording to ISC, there were 168 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on First Nations reserves in the provinces.\n\nAs numbers rise in the regions surrounding La Loche and Beauval, municipalities in the region may soon have more cases of COVID-19 than all First Nations reserves in the country combined.\n\nClearwater River Dene Nation, which is next to La Loche, has reported 16 confirmed cases.\n\n\u201cJust for those of you that do not know, the Metis community of Western Canada, nearly every reserve, you\u2019ll find a Metis village next door to it,\u201d he told the committee.\n\nThough Clearwater has a smaller population, Chartrand attributed the disparity in numbers to the fact that First Nations had pandemic plans through FNIHB while adjacent Metis villages were caught in a \u201cdark zone\u201d between jurisdictions.\n\n\u201cOur pandemic plan has been limited by our lack of access to Metis health-care services. despite all research that shows how important it is to have culturally competent and safe health-care, Metis have been shut out of the provincial and federal health-care systems,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n(Rick Laliberte is calling for a Treaty 10 pandemic council in northwestern Saskatchewan, which AFN National Chief Perry Bellegarde urged the committee to support.)\n\nChartrand also said that Metis municipalities don\u2019t have access to ISC\u2019s federal stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE), which the government says is shipped to First Nations communities within 24 hours.\n\n\u201cNone of this was distributed to the Metis community,\u201d Chartrand said, adding that Manitoba Metis purchased PPE from China instead.\n\n\u201cWhen these stockpiles are taking place in Canada, I\u2019m sad to say a leader that it\u2019s not inclusive of us. We have nothing. We don\u2019t get one mask. We don\u2019t get one band-aid, let\u2019s put it that way.\u201d\n\nMetis did receive help through the federal government\u2019s Indigenous Community Support Fund, which Chartrand said was greatly appreciated.\n\n\u201cThe $30 million is enabling the MNC\u2019s governing members or provincial affiliates to provide the immediate supports for Metis Nation citizens, families and seniors. They have developed and are rolling out action plans providing immediate supports such as food, income, supplies and rent supplements,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, the health emergency has opposed the particular vulnerability and disadvantage of the 400,000-strong Metis Nation population. It is highlighted by the distressing fact that neither level of government has taken responsibility to address the deep-seated health conditions of the Metis people in Canada,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile Metis communities in Saskatchewan have been hit hard, Manitoba has yet to confirm a case of COVID-19 in First Nations or Metis communities.\n\nRick Laliberte, the incident commander coordinating northwestern Saskatchewan\u2019s pandemic response, told APTN News the ICC was formed in part because local First Nations leaders were pulling their pandemic plans off the shelves but municipalities had \u201cno such plan.\u201d\n\nHe later called for the creation of a Treaty 10 pandemic council that would include Metis leaders, First Nations chiefs and municipal mayors.\n\nOn multiple occasions as the committee hearing progressed, AFN National Chief Perry Bellegarde encouraged Ottawa to get behind the idea of a more integrated response.\n\n\u201cSupport the Treaty 10 pandemic plan that Rick Laliberte and all the mayors and the chiefs are working on together,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSupport that.\u201d\n\nAs numbers rose in northwestern Saskatchewan, both Ottawa and Regina started sending additional material and human resources, personal protective equipment (PPE), and point-of-care rapid testing equipment.\n\nBellegarde and Chartrand urged federal and provincial governments to set jurisdictional disputes aside and work together during the public health emergency",

			'Chef Kreg Graham says he\'s been doing a lot of thinking about washing dishes now that some COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted and he can start serving meals again.\n\nThe executive chef at the Victoria-area Oak Bay Beach Hotel said much of the time he\'s spending in the kitchen preparing for a restart has been on safety protocols, not the menu.\n\n"We\'ve been doing a lot of research and brainstorming on how we can safely operate in the kitchen in tight spaces," Graham said in an interview. "Everyone understands we live in a different world now and there\'s a lot of work to be done to make sure everyone\'s safe."\n\nThe British Columbia government lifted operating restrictions placed on restaurants, pubs and some personal and health services, including hair stylists and dentists, on May 19 after a successful effort at slowing the spread on the novel coronavirus.\n\nDespite being closed since March or limited to take out, curbside and delivery services, many businesses took the week to fine tune their safety plans to protect customers and employees before reopening.\n\nGraham said ensuring a safe dishwashing area became one of his greatest concerns.\n\n"Probably the most vulnerable area in any kitchen right now is the dishwashing area," he said. "As the plates and cutlery and glasses come back into the kitchen, we are being very careful to minimize any contamination to the dishwasher personnel and the other things in the area. Every plate, spoon, fork, glass is being soaked in a sanitizing bath before being put into the dishwasher."\n\nGraham said when the kitchen is operating at full capacity, the hotel employs 25 people, but he doesn\'t expect to see that number until the fall, depending on the state of the virus.\n\nA recent Conference Board of Canada survey found most employers are not fully prepared to bring employees back to work, with many concerned about worker and customer safety and the potential impact of a second wave of COVID-19.\n\nThe survey found only eight per cent of employers were fully prepared to restart operations, while 40 per cent were close to being prepared and the remaining 52 per cent were only somewhat ready, said Allison Cowan, the board\'s director of human capital research.\n\n"What we heard is most employers are bringing people back in phases," she said in an interview from Ottawa. "Ultimately, when it comes to bringing workers back to the workplace this needs to be done carefully and responsibly. Safety is paramount and the virus will likely find loopholes in safety measures we put in place."\n\nEmployers worry about safety, cash flow, second wave in COVID-19 restart\nBridgitte Anderson, president of Greater Vancouver Board of Trade, said businesses are worried they won\'t survive if customers don\'t return.\n\n"Without revenues coming back to where they were, there\'s just going to be some unfortunate outcomes," said Anderson in an interview. "This continued new normal is likely going to continue on through the summer for sure and into the fall. This is a very gradual recovery and unfortunately that brings along with it a lot of pain."\n\nA survey of more than 1,300 member businesses by the board, the B.C. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Council of B.C. found just 26 per cent believe they can open and operate profitably with the gradual easing of COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nThe survey also found 75 per cent of businesses worry about attracting customers.\n\n"I would say the business community is under incredible pressure over the next several months as we enter more into this reopening phase," Anderson said.\n\nThe B.C. government said Friday it would allow pubs, restaurants and other businesses in the hospitality sector to apply to temporarily expand their service areas to outside patios to enlarge their footprint.',

Cette publication confirme \u00e9galement que deux grandes lign\u00e9es g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques distinctes de SRAS-CoV-2 sont \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la pand\u00e9mie, dont seulement l\u2019une des deux aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e par des humains dans un march\u00e9 public de Wuhan, en Chine.\n\nLa pand\u00e9mie de COVID-19 a \u00e9merg\u00e9 \u00e0 Wuhan, vraisemblablement dans un march\u00e9 de fruits de mer, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment dans le Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Toutefois, le fait qu\u2019un nombre consid\u00e9rable de cas initiaux de COVID-19 n\u2019ont pas eu de contacts avec ce march\u00e9 jette un doute sur le contexte particulier qui a permis au coronavirus de passer de l\u2019animal \u00e0 l\u2019humain.\n\nPour \u00e9claircir cette question, une \u00e9quipe de chercheurs de Shanghai, en Chine, a analys\u00e9 et compar\u00e9 les g\u00e9nomes des coronavirus dont \u00e9taient infect\u00e9s 94 habitants de Shanghai atteints de la COVID-19 et ceux de 221 \u00e9chantillons de SRAS-CoV-2 qui \u00e9taient accessibles sur la plateforme de partage de donn\u00e9es GISAID. Ces scientifiques ont ainsi pu identifier deux clades majeurs, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire deux grands groupes phylog\u00e9n\u00e9tiques de coronavirus distincts ayant un m\u00eame anc\u00eatre commun. Ils ont \u00e9galement remarqu\u00e9 que les coronavirus d\u00e9pist\u00e9s chez les premi\u00e8res personnes ayant re\u00e7u un diagnostic de COVID-19, d\u00e9but d\u00e9cembre, appartenaient dans certains cas au clade I et dans d\u2019autres cas au clade II.\n\nPlus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, ils ont constat\u00e9 que le g\u00e9nome des virus pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s chez six patients ayant fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 le Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market de Wuhan \u00e9tait associ\u00e9 au clade I, alors que celui de trois autres patients ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 test\u00e9s durant la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode, mais qui n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en contact avec le march\u00e9 de Wuhan, faisait partie du clade II.\n\nSelon les auteurs de l\u2019article de Nature, ces deux clades caract\u00e9ris\u00e9s par un profil g\u00e9n\u00e9tique particulier \u00ab\u2009repr\u00e9sentent vraisemblablement deux lign\u00e9es issues d\u2019un anc\u00eatre commun, mais qui ont \u00e9volu\u00e9 ind\u00e9pendamment au d\u00e9but d\u00e9cembre \u00e0 Wuhan\u2009; l\u2019une d\u2019elles, celle du clade I, se serait diss\u00e9min\u00e9e dans le march\u00e9 public, o\u00f9 la grande densit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tals, de vendeurs et de consommateurs a pu faciliter la transmission d\u2019humain \u00e0 humain, l\u2019autre se serait propag\u00e9e au d\u00e9part chez des gens qui n\u2019avaient pas eu de contacts avec le march\u00e9. \u00ab\u2009Cela ne veut donc pas dire que le virus serait pass\u00e9 de l\u2019animal \u00e0 l\u2019humain au march\u00e9, car l\u2019\u00e9tude montre que ces deux lign\u00e9es avaient un anc\u00eatre commun\u2009\u00bb, souligne la Dre C\u00e9cile Tremblay, infectiologue au CHUM.\n\nEn concordance avec cette hypoth\u00e8se, des investigations \u00e9pid\u00e9miologiques men\u00e9es sur les tout premiers cas de COVID-19 apparus \u00e0 Wuhan avant le 18 d\u00e9cembre ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que deux patients avaient eu des contacts avec le Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market tandis que cinq autres n\u2019avaient aucun lien avec ce march\u00e9.\n\nL\u2019analyse phylog\u00e9n\u00e9tique de ces deux clades sugg\u00e8re aussi que l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement zoonotique le plus ancien, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire celui de la transmission de l\u2019animal \u00e0 l\u2019humain, serait probablement survenu en novembre 2019. Les chercheurs seraient parvenus \u00e0 cette hypoth\u00e8se en raison \u00ab\u2009du peu de diversit\u00e9 dans la phylog\u00e9nie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du SRAS-CoV-2, tel que r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 par l\u2019horloge mol\u00e9culaire\u2009\u00bb.\n\n\u00ab\u2009Dans des virus, comme l\u2019influenza et le VIH, qui ont une longue histoire \u00e9volutive chez l\u2019humain, on voit plus de variabilit\u00e9, car les mutations se sont accumul\u00e9es avec le temps, alors que dans le SRAS-CoV-2, il y a relativement peu de diversit\u00e9, ce qui est compatible avec une histoire r\u00e9cente chez l\u2019humain. La date de novembre pourrait \u00eatre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e avec plus de donn\u00e9es, mais en fonction de nos connaissances actuelles, cette date est plausible\u2009\u00bb, explique Jesse Shapiro, titulaire de la Chaire de recherche du Canada en g\u00e9nomique microbienne r\u00e9volutionnaire, \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.\n\n\u00ab\u2009Cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement zoonotique survenu en novembre aurait donc produit l\u2019anc\u00eatre commun qui aurait \u00e9volu\u00e9 en ces deux lign\u00e9es, dont l\u2019une s\u2019est retrouv\u00e9e parmi les gens qui fr\u00e9quentaient le march\u00e9 de Wuhan, et l\u2019autre s\u2019est transmise ailleurs. On ne conna\u00eet donc pas non plus o\u00f9 est apparue la souche ancestrale capable de se transmettre d\u2019humain \u00e0 humain\u2009\u00bb, ajoute la Dre Tremblay.\n\n\u00c9galement, les chercheurs ont compar\u00e9 les g\u00e9nomes des virus ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s sur 112 personnes atteintes de la COVID-19, \u00e0 Shanghai, entre le 20 janvier et le 25 f\u00e9vrier, \u00e0 ceux des virus port\u00e9s par les premi\u00e8res personnes infect\u00e9es par le SRAS-CoV-2, \u00e0 Wuhan. Ils ont ainsi pu observer que le g\u00e9nome du virus continuait d\u2019\u00e9voluer, comme en t\u00e9moignent les 169 variations g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques d\u00e9cel\u00e9es dans neuf r\u00e9gions du g\u00e9nome impliqu\u00e9es dans la synth\u00e8se de prot\u00e9ines. Ces petites variations n\u2019ont toutefois pas modifi\u00e9 les manifestations cliniques du virus. C\u2019est pourquoi les auteurs de l\u2019\u00e9tude concluent que \u00ab\u2009l\u2019\u00e9volution du g\u00e9nome du coronavirus est stable\u2009\u00bb.\n\n\u00ab\u2009Comme tous les virus, le SRAS-CoV-2 continue d\u2019\u00e9voluer, et il continuera de subir des mutations, mais jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant, il n\u2019y a aucune preuve que les mutations survenues dans son g\u00e9nome ont eu un impact sur ses caract\u00e9ristiques adaptatives, notamment sur son aptitude \u00e0 se transmettre et sur la s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de la maladie qu\u2019il induit. L\u2019\u00e9volution du virus est stable dans le sens o\u00f9 elle n\u2019a pas abouti \u00e0 des souches qui ont des manifestations cliniques diff\u00e9rentes\u2009\u00bb, pr\u00e9cise M. Shapiro.\n\n\u00ab\u2009Les chercheurs n\u2019ont trouv\u00e9 aucune association entre les mutations qu\u2019ils ont observ\u00e9es dans le virus affectant les 112 patients et les manifestations cliniques de ces m\u00eames patients. Cela ne veut toutefois pas dire qu\u2019avec un plus grand \u00e9chantillon de donn\u00e9es, on ne trouvera pas d\u2019effets. Il est \u00e9galement possible que surviennent \u00e9ventuellement des mutations qui changeront les caract\u00e9ristiques du virus, et pour cette raison, il est important de continuer \u00e0 faire ce genre de surveillance\u2009\u00bb, souligne-t-il.",

With the Conservatives demanding the resumption of Commons sittings and Bloc Quebecois not involved in negotiations, that leaves the NDP.\n\nShortly before debate started on the floor of the House of Commons, Singh, the leader of the federal NDP, laid out his conditions for supporting the Liberal motion by demanding real action on paid sick leave for all Canadians and support for people with disabilities struggling with the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nDuring his daily news conference outside his home in Ottawa Monday, Trudeau said it makes sense to support paid leave for all workers if they\u2019re ill, so people who might be infected with the novel coronavirus don\u2019t have to choose between going to work sick and not getting paid.\n\n\u201cThe government will continue discussions with the provinces without delay on ensuring that as we enter the recovery phase of the pandemic, every worker in Canada who needs it has access to 10 days of paid sick leave a year,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll also consider other mechanisms for the longer term to support workers with sick leave.\u201d\n\nYet Singh said the promise fell short of the NDP\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a positive announcement today by the prime minister, but it is not enough,\u201d Singh told the House of Commons. \u201cWe need to see the action as well. And we are hopeful though that action will be coming.\u201d\n\nThe NDP leader had previously suggested the federal government use the Canada Emergency Response Benefit or employment insurance to deliver paid sick leave immediately and work with the provinces to secure two weeks of leave even after the pandemic is over.\n\nThe government must also make good on a promise to provide more support to Canadians with disabilities who are struggling during the pandemic, Singh said.",

			"In early April, Sonja Gill, rheumatologist based in Oakville, Ont., began to get shaky inquiries from some of the patients she treats who suffer from lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. They\u2019d sought to fill routine prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that quiets the symptoms of these two auto-immune conditions, but their pharmacists were saying they had none.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had call after call,\u2019\u2019 says Gill, who estimates that 70 per cent of her 1,500-patient practice are on hydroxychloroquine. She asked her administrative assistant to beat the bushes with pharmacies and wholesalers to find supplies. \n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have it, [switching to another medication] is a tough decision,\u201d Gill says. \u201cThe hard part has been telling patients what to do.\u201d\n\nThere was little mystery as to the cause. For several weeks in early April, President Donald Trump and chorus of U.S. media were talking and posting ceaselessly about how hydroxychloroquine, a generic drug, could be the miracle cure for coronavirus, allegedly reducing the levels of the virus in infected patients and thus hastening recovery.  \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not blind,\u201d Gill says of her patients. \u201cAll this stuff has been on TV since Trump tweeted about it.\u201d All of a sudden, the drug joined the inauspicious list of commodities\u2014toilet paper, Lysol wipes, flour, yeast, face masks and more\u2014experiencing pandemic-related shortages. The upshot: Gill\u2019s patients had become unwitting victims of Trump\u2019s war on science. \n\nThe hydroxychloroquine saga, which quieted following reports of over-dose deaths but has lumbered back into view in recent days with Trump claiming he\u2019s taking the drug to ward off COVID-19, offers a stark lesson in how science, social media, politics and global supply chains have collided unpredictably in this crisis. \n\nWhen reports with preliminary findings about treatments and vaccines go viral, they don\u2019t just stoke public expectations. The publicity sets off chain reactions that reverberate messily through regulatory agencies, doctors\u2019 offices, and even within drug companies that are, in some cases, forced to scramble to meet surging demand.     \n\nWhat\u2019s more, the hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus tale is by no means over. Some experts have strongly opposed the use of hydroxychloroquine, including Richard Bright, a doctor leading the U.S. federal Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, who was ousted by Trump for his outspokenness. On May 22, peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet published a study that looked at how 15,000 COVID-19 patients in almost 700 hospitals responded to various permutations of hydroxychloroquine and antibiotics. The key takeaway: -patients exhibited a heightened risk of heart arrhythmia suggesting that these treatments \u201care not useful and could be harmful in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.\u201d \n\nDespite the mounting evidence, a significant amount of clinical research into the drug\u2019s safety and efficacy is now underway, via international randomized control trials whose investigators include doctors at teaching hospitals in Ontario, Nova Scotia, Manitoba and Alberta, and hundreds of Canadian COVID-19 patients are or will be participating. If these long-term studies support the use of hydroxychloroquine, the Canadian market could face a period of jarring upheavals and shortages.\n\n* * *\n\nUnlike the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Health Canada hasn\u2019t permitted physicians to administer hydroxychloroquine, either alone or with antibiotics, to relieve COVID-19 symptoms. But medical interest in the drug was circulating before the president waded into the fray. Researchers like Kevin Kain, MD and a Canada Research Chair in infectious diseases at Toronto\u2019s University Health Network, had for several years been aware of lab research demonstrating the anti-viral properties of one of the active ingredients in hydroxychloroquine. \n\nIn early March, he joined an international team to set up a \u201cdouble blind, placebo controlled\u201d randomized clinical trial (the gold standard), to examine the potential of using the drug preventatively for frontline health care workers. \u201cThis was all way before Trump  poisoned the waters with misinformation and the release of one very poor quality \u2018study\u2019 from France,\u201d Kain says. \n\nThe French study, published online in the International Journal of Anti-microbial Agents  involved 42 patients and was later tweeted by Trump. Of those treated with the drug, the pr\u00e9cis claims they showed a \u201csignificant reduction\u201d in infection, although the comments at the end concede the results are \u201cpreliminary.\u201d (The New York Times recently published a hard-hitting profile of the lead investigator, a charismatic microbiologist named Didier Raoult, questioning his earlier research.)\n\nMORE: Coronavirus in Canada: how to get tested, what the symptoms are, where to get help\n\nOne doesn\u2019t need to have a PhD to know that such small samples don\u2019t produce definitive results. Medical ethicist Sunit Das, an associate professor at the University of Toronto\u2019s Centre for Ethics, notes that the French paper says it is a case study using \u201clevel\u2013three evidence,\u201d a term all medical researchers understand. \u201cThis is not the sort of evidence that should drive clinical treatment,\u201d says Das.  \n\nKain, however, goes much further, dismissing the French paper as \u201cshoddy work that shouldn\u2019t have been published.\u201d (Das disagrees.) But the fact is that it was published online, on journal sites without paywalls, meaning these findings were available to anyone. Research from the Journal of the American Medical Association, which analyzes internet searches of hydroxychloroquine, shows that the release of the French study coincided with the steep slope that begins with a tweet by Elon Musk and crests in mid-March with Trump\u2019s endorsement. \n\nAnother pair of small-ish studies, one done in Brazil, the other in several veterans\u2019 hospitals in the U.S., concludes the opposite: that hydroxychloroquine is either ineffective or unsafe. Kain says these findings\u2014one based on 81 cases and the other on 368 patients\u2014fuelled a backlash. They informed disparaging comments made by Richard Bright, the ousted U.S. official. (A larger study of 1,466 people admitted to ER with COVID-19 and published in early May in the New England Journal of Medicine was inconclusive.)\n\nSome of these studies looked at high-dose treatments, and one wasn\u2019t even peer-reviewed before it went online. Almost any drug, consumed in large amounts, can be toxic, Kain says. He also stresses that his goal as a scientist isn\u2019t to prove that hydroxychloroquine is a miracle treatment, but rather to answer the question about its efficacy definitely and rigorously.\n\nWhile Health Canada is allowing anyone being treated in a hospital for COVID-19 to participate one of the many clinical trials now underway, researchers in both Canada and the U.S. say it\u2019s been difficult recruiting participants because of sensational media reports about people dying after ingesting high doses of hydroxychloroquine. While the drug does have heart, kidney and liver side effects, Kain points out that physicians have been using it safely for 70 years, so it\u2019s not difficult for researchers to structure trials to ensure proper doses. \n\n* * *\n\nIn late March, Mint Pharmaceuticals, a Mississauga, Ont.-based generic drug manufacturer that distributes about 60 per cent of all hydroxychloroquine used in Canada, received two very large orders from a wholesaler that provides pharmaceuticals to hospitals. The orders, equivalent to all the hydroxychloroquine used in Canada in 2019, set off alarm bells.\n\nJust days before, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration made the contentious and subsequently criticized decision to allow physicians to use hydroxychloroquine, in conjunction with an antibiotic, to treat COVID-19. \n\nFederal officials in Ottawa began monitoring the situation and conferring with Canadian suppliers in weekly \u201cstakeholder\u201d calls. No one at the time understood why Canadian hospitals would be stockpiling, but the huge orders raised the prospect that \u201clegacy\u201d patients (those with lupus or rheumatoid arthritis) may not be able to fill prescriptions.\n\nAccording to Mint CEO Jaiveer Singh, the fast-growing firm has been making and distributing hydroxychloroquine in Canada since 2014, generating about $7 million on the drug in 2019. Mint\u2019s not the only generic firm distributing it in Canada, but the competition in recent years has narrowed. Some global players have abandoned the product in Canada because the going price\u2014set by provincial drug formularies\u2014has fallen, and is now well below what hydroxychloroquine costs in the U.S. \n\nBy late March, Singh warned Health Canada officials that those large hospital orders could quickly soak up pharmacy supply normally used to fill prescriptions for patients with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. \u201cWe were really concerned,\u201d Singh says. He urged the government to place a large emergency order to ensure there was enough to go around. \u201cThe federal government at that point,\u201d he says, \u201ctook more of a cautious approach. They didn\u2019t want to increase the stockpile.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when the supply chain issues began to loom large. Thanks to the pandemic, the costs of the active ingredient in the drug and shipping had all jumped while the Canadian dollar was plunging. Singh says he worries about continuing to supply the Canadian market if the company costs exceed the prices set by the provinces. \n\nMint\u2019s manufacturing partner for hydroxychloroquine is a large producer in India, which, as Singh says, has become the world\u2019s pharmacy. As global demand for the drug surged (on the wave of Trump\u2019s tweets), and the pandemic took hold in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government closed the border to pharmaceutical exports, disrupting international supply chains. \n\nAfter Ottawa had finally agreed to increase Canada\u2019s emergency storehouse for legacy patients in mid-April, Singh, senior government officials and the Indian consulate in Toronto began hustling to secure a five-million-tablet shipment from Mint\u2019s Indian supplier, to be exempted from the export ban on humanitarian grounds. The drugs arrived in Mint\u2019s Mississauga warehouse in early May and are being stored in a cage monitored around the clock by closed-circuit cameras.\n\nAnd what about those big hospital orders Mint had to fill? Some of those tablets will likely be used in the clinical trials now underway across Canada. But we won\u2019t know the results until later in the year, at the earliest. If they prove this venerable malaria drug does treat COVID-19, Singh says Mint will ramp up production to serve the Canadian market. But the inevitable scramble will bring other difficult choices: who should get first crack at the drug: COVID-19 sufferers or the lupus and arthritis patients who would have to take stronger alternatives? \n\nBeyond the particulars of the hydroxychloroquine tale, this episode raises\u2014or re-visits\u2014broader ethical questions about the rapid dissemination of half-baked research to a hyper-connected world that can\u2019t wait to rid itself of this virus. \n\nStories about other premature findings\u2014the latest being news reports that Moderna Inc., a publicly-traded $26 billion-a-year biotech giant, had encouraging results for eight healthy people injected with a trial vaccine\u2014continue to find their way out of the normally staid scientific literature ecosystem and into the hurricane that is social media.\n\nThis dynamic has prompted concern to ripple through the highest echelons of the medical research establishment. \u201cThe pandemic will inevitably leave considerable morbidity, mortality, and loss in its wake,\u201d the New England Journal of Medicine opined. \u201cDamage to the country\u2019s medication-assessment process\u2014and the public\u2019s respect for it\u2014should not be part of its legacy.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, rheumatologist Sonja Gill is just hoping that her patients won\u2019t have to face yet another round of unnerving shortages triggered by the viral spread of research results that have yet to be exposed to proper scientific scrutiny.

			'Premier Doug Ford is pleading with people who live in Ontario\'s COVID-19 "hotspots" to get tested for the virus \u2014 but officials won\'t specify which neighbourhoods have been hardest hit.\n\nFord mentioned the province\'s coronavirus hotspots multiple times during his daily news conference Monday. He said the government is able to measure them by postal code, and that some areas are "lighting up like a Christmas tree."\n\n"We want to encourage people in the hotspots \u2026 please get tested," Ford said.\n\nBut that data has not been made public. CBC News has requested a breakdown of cases by postal code, but Hayley Chazan, spokesperson for the provincial minister of health, would only say that Ontario\'s hardest-hit regions are in Toronto, Peel Region and Windsor-Essex County.\n\nFord elaborated slightly Monday afternoon, saying "parts" of those regions were most affected. He also mentioned parts of Brampton, north Etobicoke and Scarborough.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the province, Toronto-area public health units account for 64.8 per cent of Ontario\'s cases.\n\n\nPremier Doug Ford says the testing will be narrowed to some postal codes that are \'lighting up like a Christmas tree\' and need greater attention. 1:09\n"We\'re going to get people out where the hotspots are and get them tested," Ford said, though he did not elaborate on exactly how that would happen.\n\nFord said the province plans to launch "the next steps" of its testing strategy in the coming days. The first steps of that plan began this weekend, he said, with testing of hospital workers \u2014 symptomatic or not \u2014 and inmates and staff in correctional facilities.\n\n"I want as many people tested as possible," he said.\n\nBut that hasn\'t been happening. Ontario has routinely been missing its testing target in recent days, with just 8,170 tests processed since the province\'s last daily update. \n\nThat\'s far below the benchmark of 16,000 per day and nowhere near the almost 20,000 tests Ontario has the capacity to handle on any given day. The backlog of tests waiting to be processed is sitting at 3,883.\n\nFord, who has repeatedly stated he wants to see more testing, said Monday the province\'s plan "will take time to fully ramp up."\n\nAvoiding stigma\nBut the province might be reluctant to name the hotspots because of the stigma that could cause, says Dr. David Fisman, professor of epidemiology at the University of Toronto\'s Dalla Lana School of Public Health.\n\n"I think we know more than what is being discussed publicly about where the hotspots are, particularly within the [Toronto area]," Fisman, who is also a physician at Michael Garron Hospital, said Monday on CBC Radio\'s Metro Morning.\n\nOntario to maintain group size restrictions amid rising COVID-19 cases, crowded parks\n"I think there are some very important discussions happening internally in public health agencies about stigma. Because this happens again and again with infectious diseases \u2014 where you draw a circle around a place that has higher rates of infection, and all of a sudden folks say \'that\'s where the infectious people are,\'" he said.\n\n"I think there\'s a great desire not to create that kind of dialogue or that kind of rhetoric in Toronto."\n\n\nNurses with the William Osler Health System perform COVID-19 testing at a drive-in centre near Etobicoke General Hospital. Ontario has routinely missed its testing targets in recent days. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)\nFisman also said that health units in particularly affected areas need help to snuff out the virus. That would include support for people in dense areas who might have trouble physically distancing, protective equipment for front-line workers, and mobile testing for people who have difficulties getting to a testing centre.\n\n"I don\'t think this is about enforcement or further stigmatization," he said.\n\n"I think this is about supporting vulnerable parts of the GTA so that we can get this done."',

However, we recognize that the present pandemic might not have provided the best conditions for people to provide feedback on the Market Basket Measure review,\u201d said agency spokesperson Peter Frayne.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, Statistics Canada and ESDC will be extending the review period by an additional two months to the end of August.\u201d\n\nThe measure is based on five general categories of costs needed to maintain an adequate standard of living across 50 different regions in Canada.\n\nREAD MORE: Poverty rate sees decline, as StatCan set to move to redrawn poverty line\n\nAs it stands, the base year for the measure remains 2008, meaning certain costs such as housing are now outdated. \n\nSince the Liberals formed government in late 2015, more than one million Canadians have risen above the poverty line. It includes both for the 2008 base year measure and a preliminary 2018 measure offered by Statistics Canada in February, when the 2018 Canadian Income Survey was released.\n\nFrayne said following the review period, Statistics Canada will expedite publication of new poverty figures. \n\nHe added the release of the new poverty line will \u201cprovide important contextual information on the situations of Canadians prior to the COVID pandemic.\u201d\n\nWhile a bump in the official poverty rate is expected once the new measure is used, the pandemic has hit Canadians working lower wage jobs particularly hard, meaning some of the real gains in reducing poverty under the Liberal government could be erased if economic recovery efforts exclude them.",

			"As the House returns to debate a motion on how to proceed amid the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a \u201cneed\u201d for MPs to stay focused on responding to the fallout of the pandemic instead of other priorities, says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. \n\n\u201cWork still continues throughout the government on important non-COVID priorities, but right now, in Parliament, the focus needs to be on the crisis that has taken over almost every aspect of Canadians\u2019 lives and of our economy,\u201d Mr. Trudeau (Papineau, Que.) said in his daily briefing to reporters on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work to address the needs that Canadians face, both through this health crisis, and into the economic challenges, as we begin to recover from this COVID-19 crisis,\u201d he told reporters ahead of Parliament\u2019s debate on the future of proceedings. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we have Parliament and its institutions function well, and that\u2019s what we are continuing to demonstrate.\u201d\n\nThe House was suspended on March 13, but has been recalled on a few occasions to pass emergency legislation. An April motion that was backed by the Liberals and other opposition parties, except for the Conservatives\u2014who pushed for more in-person meetings\u2014saw the creation of a special COVID-19 committee that allowed MPs to meet virtually on Tuesdays and Thursdays. That motion also allowed one in-person sitting in the Chamber on Wednesdays, but the deal has expired. \n\nMr. Trudeau\u2019s Liberals pitched a motion last week that would allow the committee to meet for an extra day each week, on Mondays, and see a small number of MPs reconvene in the Chamber, along with some MPs from outside of Ottawa, who would join via videoconference, which itself would be streamed in the Chamber. The government has framed it as a proposal that respects public health advice on gatherings while still ensuring accountability and transparency.\n\nThe Conservatives said they will table their own motion that would declare Parliament an essential service, in an effort to call for all committees to begin meeting virtually. So far, eight committees have been given the green light to meet and discuss issues around the pandemic. The Liberals\u2019 motion adds the Fisheries and Oceans Committee to that list, an addition that the NDP supports. Committees would also be allowed to discuss matters unrelated to the pandemic under the Liberals\u2019 motion.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh (Burnaby South, B.C.) told reporters Monday that his party\u2019s support for the government\u2019s motion is dependent on a commitment to provide paid sick leave to those who contract COVID-19. Mr. Singh said a short-term fix would require a \u201cslight modification\u201d to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, a program that provides $2,000 up to four months for those who have been furloughed or forced to leave work to care for someone with the virus. Additionally, the NDP has asked the government to provide further support to those living with a disability.\n\n\u201cWithout those two things, we will not support the government. With those two things, we\u2019re prepared to support,\u201d Mr. Singh said. \u201cWe proposed a way of going forward, and our proposal was to have a hybrid system, with MPs participating physically and virtually, and to sit four days throughout the summer in order to be able to hold the government to account to ask questions.\u201d\n\nIn the long term, he said, he wants to see the government commit to working with the provinces to develop a paid-sick leave program. Mr. Singh said B.C. Premier John Horgan has already expressed a willingness to work with the feds.\n\nMr. Trudeau in his remarks cited \u201congoing discussions\u201d with jurisdictions about how to create such a program that will allow workers 10 days of sick paid leave. \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want people to go back to work when they\u2019re sick. In order to prevent that from happening, we\u2019re prepared to work with the provinces to put in place a paid sick leave program,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for the bill, we\u2019ll have to work on that and determine that, but the purpose is very clear; we don\u2019t want people to feel forced to go back into work if they have symptoms of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nHis comments appear to be in direct response to the NDP\u2019s push for 10 days of paid sick leave, in exchange for the opposition party\u2019s support for its motion.\n\nHe also defended the Liberal Party\u2019s application to the federal wage subsidy program, which covers 75 per cent of an employer\u2019s wages for those who have seen a significant revenue dip. Organizations must show a 30 per cent drop in revenues compared to this time last year, and it is open to charities and nonprofits. The NDP, Greens, and the Conservatives have also applied for the benefit, according to CBC, while the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has decided not to apply. \n\n\u201cThe reality is that there are workers in all types of industries, in all types of organizations right across the country, who depend on their job and their salary to help their family and pay for their groceries and rent,\u201d said Mr. Trudeau. \u201cWe made the decision to ensure that that wage subsidy would be accessible to businesses and nonprofit organizations. That is a decision that will allow the economy to come back strong afterwards and I believe it was the right decision, because we must be able to support Canadians, in whatever organizations or company they work for.\u201d\n\nBloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet (Beloeil\u2014Chambly, Que.) on Monday criticized the move,  calling it \u201cabsolutely unacceptable.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe money is not a gift provided to the people by the government, because they are nice people. It is reserved for businesses, the companies and the people who really need it,\u201d he said, taking shots at the Liberals and Conservatives who he said \u201cdon\u2019t need it.\u201d\n\nMr. Trudeau refused to say if when the program and criteria were designed, it was done so in anticipation that political parties would be among those applying.",

			'Because of physical distancing, Darryl Falzarano and his colleagues couldn\u2019t celebrate with a group hug when they completed a successful test of their candidate vaccine for COVID-19.\n\nNor could they share their promising results with other colleagues at the University of Saskatchewan\u2019s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organizaton-International Vaccine Centre, since they are the only scientists allowed to come to work in the Saskatoon-based facility.\n\nBut it was exciting news nonetheless when their readouts showed that the ferrets in their study were able to fight off the disease after receiving two doses of the team\u2019s in-house vaccine. The positive outcome sets the stage for tests with human subjects, which could begin as early as this fall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what we were looking for, so that tells us to continue on the path that we\u2019re on,\u201d said Dr. Falzarano, who is the lead investigator on the project.\n\nThe Saskatoon team, which had previously been working toward a vaccine for MERS, a related disease caused by a different coronavirus, pivoted to working on COVID-19 as soon at the genetic sequence of the virus was published in February. Weeks later, their lab was the first in Canada to isolate the virus.\n\nThe team\u2019s results, announced on Monday, are the latest hopeful sign that \u2013 so far \u2013 Canadian researchers and their global counterparts are making progress in their efforts to produce a vaccine that will be safe and effective against COVID-19.\n\nEarlier this month, Quebec-based biotech company Medicago Inc. announced positive results of animal studies with its vaccine candidate. Last week, IMV Inc., another Quebec company, said it is in a similar position. Both companies have indicated that they hope to begin clinical trials this summer pending Health Canada approval.\n\nMeanwhile, a clinical trial of the first and only COVID-19 vaccine that is already approved for human testing in Canada is set to begin next week and could grow to include as many as 600 participants by the end of August.\n\nThe vaccine was produced by CanSino Biologics, a Chinese company, using an approach that stems from an earlier collaboration with Canada\u2019s National Research Council. It was first tested in a non-randomized clinical trial that involved 108 subjects in Wuhan. Last week, the effort yielded the first peer-reviewed study of any COVID-19 vaccine, published on Friday in the medical journal The Lancet. Researchers in China reported that their subjects experienced mostly mild to moderate reactions, and that the vaccine stimulated the production of antibodies that can neutralize the virus. More work will be needed to confirm the result. This will include the Canadian trial. But even larger trials will be needed to show if the vaccine is truly effective at preventing COVID-19. Even if all proceeds without a hitch, most experts do not expect a vaccine that is widely available for the public until next year.\n\nScientists caution that even at the breakneck speed with which the vaccine research is being conducted, it is still early days. Many candidate vaccines are likely to fail. Even those that succeed in animal studies and are shown to be safe for humans may produce lacklustre results once studies expand.\n\nThis why the global race to develop a vaccine is proceeding in multiple directions. As some candidates flame out, others will take over as front runners. And should more than one vaccine prove to be effective, it could turn out that different vaccines will work best for different subpopulations or age groups.\n\n"There are a number of reasons to have multiple eggs in the basket,\u201d said Scott Halperin, director of the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology in Halifax, which is organizing the trial of the CanSino vaccine. \u201cThe more candidates you have, the more likely you\u2019re going to have a success.\u201d\n\nSeveral years ago, Dr. Halperin, who is also a professor at Dalhousie University, was involved in developing an adjuvant \u2013 a compound that primes the immune system and can improve a vaccine\u2019s performance. The Saskatoon team is using the adjuvant in its vaccine.\n\nAfter the candidate vaccine was developed in March, the team administered it to ferrets in two immunizations 28 days apart. After another 28 days, half the animals were exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19. The animals generated a strong immune response and produced antibodies that neutralized the virus.\n\n\u201cBased on our MERS data, we expected it to work in ferrets ... but you never know in science\u201d Dr. Falzarano said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have years of experience [with COVID-19], we have months.\u201d\n\nMedicago\u2019s president and chief executive officer, Bruce Clark, said his company\u2019s vaccine was tested in mice, which also generated antibodies. Further tests are needed to determine if those antibodies can neutralize the novel coronavirus. But Dr. Clark, who holds a PhD in biochemistry, said he was encouraged that the mice produced antibodies within 10 days after one shot of the vaccine. This suggests that if the vaccine is effective in humans, its immunizing effects will emerge quickly, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you have as serious a disease as COVID, you don\u2019t want something that\u2019s going to take three months to generate the maximum response,\u201d Dr. Clark added.',

			"As tech companies across the country begin to offer more long-term work-from-home options, experts believe there will still be a role for the traditional office space in the future.\n\nIn April, a Statistics Canada survey indicated that 4.7 million Canadians began to work remotely as part of measures meant to limit the spread of COVID-19, while another 2.1 million Canadians were already working from home before the outbreak began.\n\nSome tech companies, including Shopify, Google, Facebook and Twitter, have all began offering extended work-from-home options for their employees.\n\nHuda Idrees, the founder and CEO of Dot Health, an app that collects and stores the user\u2019s health information, said her company will also adopt permanent work-from-home measures once the contract for their downtown Toronto office expires at the end of the year.\n\n\u201cWhat we found is that we were quite productive working remotely,\u201d she told CTV News.\n\nThere are plenty of obvious benefits to working from home, including a relaxed schedule and more time with family because there\u2019s no longer a commute.\n\nHowever, Zabeen Hirji, executive advisor for Future of Work, believes the offices aren\u2019t going anywhere, even as more people shift home.\n\n\u201cI think there will be a need to bring people together physically and it could be that people work three days from home and two days from the office,\u201d she said.\n\nHirji also served as the chief human resources officer at the Royal Bank of Canada for 10 years and said some employees were still hesitant to work from home as the company began offering more options to do so.\n\n\u201cRBC had flexible work arrangements and the option to work form home some of the time, but I was not comfortable taking advantage of it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was stigma attached to it.\u201d\n\nHirji said the employees she\u2019s talked to also have concerns with working from home, including less productivity, lengthy virtual meetings and missing a social interaction with colleagues.\n\n\u201cThere are people that can\u2019t work from home,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can\u2019t work from home because they don\u2019t have the space (or) because they feel isolated.\u201d\n\nThat said, a reduced reliance on office spaces could be a big problem for cities.\n\n\u201cWhen the rent starts to decline the leases stop renewing at the same rate then that valuation of properties may go down,\u201d said Murtaza Haider, professor of real estate management at Ryerson University.\n\nIn Toronto, the municipal government collects more than $4.5 billion annually in property taxes, nearly half of which is from companies.",

			"After images and videos surfaced of thousands flocking to Trinity Bellwoods Park in Toronto, there was public outrage and pleas from officials urging people to adhere to social distancing rules to avoid a more severe second wave of the coronavirus.\n\nPossible outdoor transmission may not be a major driver of a second COVID-19 wave, but experts interviewed by Global News said it could make future outbreaks more extreme.\nDr. Alon Vaisman, an infection control and infectious diseases physician at Toronto\u2019s University Health Network, said what happened at Trinity Bellwoods was troubling but transmissions are more likely to occur indoors, where a majority of outbreaks in Canada have been detected so far.\n\u201cIn these public settings and the outdoors, the likelihood of transmission is low still. But if you multiply that out by numerous people, then you\u2019re starting to increase the likelihood that something will happen,\u201d he said.\n\nHow punishing the next wave of infection will be will most likely be the result of indoor habits, said Vaisman. But park overcrowding could bring the city back to a stage where much higher rates of transmission threaten to overwhelm the health-care system \u2014 what Vaisman dubs \u201cthe unsafe zone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second wave is inevitable. There\u2019s no doubt about that. And third, fourth, those are all inevitable waves. There\u2019s going to be waves and waves and waves into this. There\u2019s nothing, there\u2019s no way to permanently fix that until a vaccine comes around,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere is a question of how severe it is\u2026 And that\u2019s what large gatherings do, they make make the waves worse than they have to be.\u201d\nHe noted that some of the responsibility falls on federal and provincial governments, who he criticized as having implied that the world will be able to return to a full normal after the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThere are certain things are just simply never going to come back. A lot of things that we\u2019ve done before \u2014 bars, restaurants, concerts, sporting events, they simply are never going to be safe for a long time,\u201d Vaisman said.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t let people know that, then they\u2019re inevitably going to behave in such a way that\u2019s dangerous because they\u2019re just going back to the way things were.\u201d\n\nThe City of Toronto spoke out in a statement against the \u201cunacceptable\u201d behaviour of those who crowded Trinity Bellwoods Park on Saturday, warning of a possible COVID-19 surge.\n\u201cGatherings like this, where people aren\u2019t keeping their distance from others, run the risk of setting Toronto back significantly in its efforts to stop the transmission of COVID-19,\u201d the statement read.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau, too, addressed the large crowds, reminding Canadians to wear masks when keeping two metres apart was not possible and to do their best to follow public health rules.\n\nDr. Susan J. Bondy, an associate professor at the University of Toronto\u2019s Dalla Lana School of Public Health, said it is unclear exactly how dangerous these actions are because the medical community is still learning about the risk of COVID-19 in specific environmental settings \u2014 \u201cbut there is really good reason to be concerned.\u201d\n\nBondy said it was \u201cdisturbing\u201d to see the size of the crowds at the Toronto park in a series of viral photos and videos online, especially given the high number of COVID-19 cases found in Ontario.\n\nImages showed many people sitting closer than two metres apart. Many were exercising. Some were shouting and singing, all of which Bondy said have been associated with \u201cclear outbreaks\u201d in various parts of the world.\nCOVID-19 is transmitted from person-to-person, many of whom will be asymptomatic for several days before showing symptoms, she said.\n\n\u201cIf somebody in that crowd was infectious but thought it was just seasonal allergies or if somebody was in that crowd and is about to get symptoms themselves in a couple of days, others will have been exposed.\u201d\n\nAn \u201cunknown, untold number\u201d of local regional flare-ups and continued outbreaks, rather than waves \u2014 which imply a single pattern that could affect an entire province at once \u2014 will be expected until a vaccine is developed, Bondy said.\n\u201cThis kind of event is exactly the kind of thing that leads to larger outbreaks,\u201d she added. \n\nInfectious diseases specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch said flocking to parks was \u201ccounterproductive,\u201d but hoped it would serve as an example of what not to do.\n\u201cThis is clearly not how people should be behaving in the course of a pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut if that one event was truly isolated to Trinity Bellwoods, as is hopefully the case, then hopefully this does not amount to a large explosion of cases and hopefully given the tremendous public outcry toward the scenes that were shared widely throughout the country, hopefully that\u2019s enough to prevent scenes like that from happening again.\u201d",
