        THE PROBLEM
      </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="abtParagraph">
      <p>
        In consuming news and content online, users tend to prefer content that
        aligns with and reaffirms their existing beliefs, this is known as the
        echo chamber effect (Jamieson & Cappella, 2008; Sunstein, 2002). The
        echo chamber effect pushes people into silos and exacerbates
        polarization, particularly with the rise of online news consumption and
        social media. The tendency to fall into an echo chamber can be fed by
        personal preference and habits (Dubois & Blank, 2018), or by filter
        bubbles- which is when news aggregators’ and social media platforms’
        algorithms only serve you content which affirms your existing belief
        (Pariser, 2011). When users are stuck in echo chambers online, they are
        more susceptible to disinformation because citizens lack a common
        understanding of shared facts (citation needed). By having their own
        beliefs reconfirmed and echoed back to them, users also don’t develop
        and practice the critical thinking skills necessary for identifying and
        avoiding misinformation (citation needed).

        THE APPROACH
      </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="abtParagraph">
      <p>
        At KickBait, our approach to countering disinformation online is to
        challenge the echo chambers that users find themselves in. We have done
        this by creating an educational tool which allows users to situate their
        own news consumption habits within the Canadian media ecosystem, based
        on the level of political polarization of the content they consume and
        its credibility. This tool encourages critical thinking and creates an
        opportunity for users to critically reflect on their online news
        consumption habits. We believe that if users can recognize that they are
        in an echo chamber, they will be better equipped to take actions to get
        out the echo chamber. This tool encourages users to develop positive
        habits to get out of echo chambers including: Reading content they
        disagree with; Checking a news source that’s different from what they
        normally read; and Trying to confirm political information by searching
        online for another source (Dubois, 2017).

        THE METHODOLOGY
      </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="abtParagraph">
      <p>
        We believe transparency in how this tool has been created is essential.
        It is necessary to share the methodology for ranking within each
        category, so reasonable people of differing political beliefs can rank
        the same sources and come up with similar results.

        METHODOLOGY FOR THE DEMO
      </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="abtParagraph">
      <p>
        For the map we have presented here, we selected 25 online news media
        sources based on their overall popularity in the Canadian news ecosystem
        as well as their political distribution. This selection is based on a
        2019 study on political polarization in Canada led by Dr. Taylor
        Owens.<br />
        We then used an existing media ranking resource called Media Bias/ Fact
        Check to provide a ranking for each source, based on its level of
        political partisanship and credibility.<br /><br />
        Media Bias/ Fact Check provides a ranking of political partisanship
        based on the following four criteria:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Biased words/ headline: Does the source use loaded words to convey
          emotion to sway the reader. Do headlines match the story.
        </li>
        <li>
          Factual/Sourcing: Does the source report factually and back up claims
          with well sourced evidence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Story Choices: Does the source report news from both sides or do they
          only publish one side.
        </li>
        <li>
          Political Affiliation: How strongly does the source endorse a
          particular political ideology. How extreme are their views?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      Political Partisanship rankings were distributed according to left and
      right political ideology. This approach has various limitations and
      challenges: positions that are considered on the left or right of the
      political spectrum change over time, there isn’t always a “centre” on each
      topic, definitions or liberal and conservative are contested between
      individuals, and its contested whether there are more dimensions to
      consider than just liberal/ conservative (Otero, 2018).<br /><br />
      Our aim with this tool is not to engage with political ideological debate,
      but to encourage positive media consumption habits. To address this
      limitation, we adjusted the political partisanship ranking to be from
      neutral to extremely partisan. In this way, both extreme left and extreme
      right content will fall on the same side of the map. We believe the issue
      isn’t in what side of the political spectrum you fall on, but how neutral
      your news sources are. <br /><br />
      Media Bias/ Fact Check provides a ranking of credibility based on the
      factual reporting score above. Based on the rankings provided by Media
      Bias/ Fact Check, we assigned each source a score out of ten for political
      partisanship and credibility to place it on our map. <br /><br />
      We recognize several possible issues in methodology followed by Media
      Bias/ Fact Check. For example, with a single organization conducting the
      ranking, its own internal biases can inform its interpretation of the
      content. Further, many of the measures outlined above, particularly
      political affiliation can be highly subjective. <br /><br />
      A few of the Canadian sites included in our list were not available on
      Media Bias/ Fact Check, so we ranked them ourselves, following the
      criteria outlined by Media Bias/ Fact Check. <br /><br />
      However, this resource was valuable to provide a baseline rating system
      for us to build a demo of how our tool will work. More work will need to
      be done on mapping news sources in the Canadian context, which we outline
      below. <br /><br />

        FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS
      </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="abtParagraph">
      <p>
        The rankings we have provided here are preliminary, as a means to
        demonstrate how the tool works. Moving forward, we plan to learn from
        the methodology of similar organizations to provide nuanced and credible
        rankings for news media in Canada.<br /><br />
        Extensive work is being done on this in the American context, by
        organizations such as AllSides’ Media Bias Chart and Ad Fonte Media’s
        Media Bias Chart. Both of these organizations have extensively
        researched and ranked hundreds of news outlets and mapped them according
        to political partisanship. However, in Canada we are just starting to
        catch up.<br /><br />
        AllSides ranks only media bias, not the accuracy or credibility of
        facts. They use multiple methods to determine the bias of a source
        including by asking the following questions<br />
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          What’s your bias?
        </li>
        <li>
          What’s the bias of this article?
        </li>
        <li>
          How does every “bias group” rate this article?
        </li>
        <li>
          What’s the average bias rating of several articles from this source?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        They also use blind bias surveys, editorial review, third party
        analysis, and independent reviews to review the bias of a source. By
        combining multiple methods, they can provide a more credible and
        objective rating.<br /><br />
        Ad Fonte conducts complex analysis of the content of stories from each
        source using individual sentences as the unit of analysis. They present
        the ranking of each news source as a weighted average of this analysis.
        As news articles continue to be published and analysed, the position of
        a source on the chart will move over time. To measure the quality of
        news, they use three metrics:<br />
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Veracity: based on fact checkers
        </li>
        <li>
          Expression: based on syntax and intent of sentence
        </li>
        <li>
          Fairness: based on Federal Rules of Evidence, which a judge uses to
          rule on objections in court
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To measure the political partisanship of news, they consider both the
        political position bias (how extreme the idea or policy is), and
        linguistic expression bias (the degree to which an article promotes a
        political position through linguistic rhetoric).
