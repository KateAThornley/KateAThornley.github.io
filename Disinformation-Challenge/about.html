        THE PROBLEM
      </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="abtParagraph">
      <p>
        In consuming news and content online, users tend to prefer content that
        aligns with and reaffirms their existing beliefs, this is known as the
        echo chamber effect (Jamieson & Cappella, 2008; Sunstein, 2002). The
        echo chamber effect pushes people into silos and exacerbates
        polarization, particularly with the rise of online news consumption and
        social media. The tendency to fall into an echo chamber can be fed by
        personal preference and habits (Dubois & Blank, 2018), or by filter
        bubbles- which is when news aggregators’ and social media platforms’
        algorithms only serve you content which affirms your existing belief
        (Pariser, 2011). When users are stuck in echo chambers online, they are
        more susceptible to disinformation because citizens lack a common
        understanding of shared facts (citation needed). By having their own
        beliefs reconfirmed and echoed back to them, users also don’t develop
        and practice the critical thinking skills necessary for identifying and
        avoiding misinformation (citation needed).

        THE APPROACH
      </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="abtParagraph">
      <p>
        At KickBait, our approach to countering disinformation online is to
        challenge the echo chambers that users find themselves in. We have done
        this by creating an educational tool which allows users to situate their
        own news consumption habits within the Canadian media ecosystem, based
        on the level of political polarization of the content they consume and
        its credibility. This tool encourages critical thinking and creates an
        opportunity for users to critically reflect on their online news
        consumption habits. We believe that if users can recognize that they are
        in an echo chamber, they will be better equipped to take actions to get
        out the echo chamber. This tool encourages users to develop positive
        habits to get out of echo chambers including: Reading content they
        disagree with; Checking a news source that’s different from what they
        normally read; and Trying to confirm political information by searching
        online for another source (Dubois, 2017).

        THE METHODOLOGY
      </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="abtParagraph">
      <p>
        We believe transparency in how this tool has been created is essential.
        It is necessary to share the methodology for ranking within each
        category, so reasonable people of differing political beliefs can rank
        the same sources and come up with similar results.
