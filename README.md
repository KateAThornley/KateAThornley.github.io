This repository is mostly used for the labs of course SEG3125. 
SEG3125 is a Design and Analysis of User Interfaces course taught at the University of Ottawa by Dr. Caroline Barriere.

(other side projects used for hackathons/demos are stored under this repo- they are distinguished by not being labeled "lab" in the main folder)
